An object slides down the ramp from $A$ to $B$.
The height $H$ and width $L$ of the ramp are fixed.  The angle $\alpha$ can be
chosen.

The height of the vehicle above the ground is $h(t)$.

\problem What is the relation between the velocity $v$ of the vehicle and
$dh/dt$?

\problem
Compute the force $F$ that is acting on the vehicle in the direction of the
slide.

\problem Physics says that the sum of kinetic and potential energies are
constant.  Prove that this follows from Newton' laws, i.e.~show directly from
Newton's law ``$F=ma$'' that
\[
  \frac{d}{dt}\Bigl(\frac12 mv^2 + mgh(t)\Bigr) = 0.
\]
Assuming that the vehicle was not moving when it started at the top, how much is
\[
  E = \frac12 mv^2 + mgh(t) \; ?
\]

\problem Find a formula for $\frac{dh}{ dt}$ in terms of $h$ (i.e.~if you know
the height $h$ then how much is $\frac{dh}{dt}$?)

\problem How long does it take the vehicle to reach the floor?

\problem How long does it take the vehicle to go from $A$ to $B$?

\problem Which angle $\alpha$ makes the descent time as small as possible?
