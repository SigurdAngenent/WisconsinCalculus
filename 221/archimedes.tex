% The Archimedes problem about approximating 
\problem \groupproblem (\textit{Geometry \& Trig review})
Let $A_n$ be the area of the
regular $n$-gon inscribed in the unit circle, and let $B_n$ be the area of
the regular $n$-gon whose inscribed circle has radius 1.

\textbf{(a)} Show that $A_n < \pi < B_n$.

\textbf{(b)} Show that
\[
A_n = \frac n2 \sin\frac{2\pi}{n} \text{ and } B_n = n \tan\frac\pi n
\]

\textbf{(c)} Compute $\lim_{n\toi}A_n$ and $\lim_{n\toi}B_n$.

\medskip\noindent Here is a picture of $A_{12}$, $B_6$ and $\pi$:

On a historical note: Archimedes managed to compute $A_{96}$ and
$B_{96}$ and by doing this got the most accurate approximation for
$\pi$ that was known in his time.  See also:
