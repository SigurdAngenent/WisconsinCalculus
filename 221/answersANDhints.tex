The decimal expansion of
\[
1/7 = 0.\overline{142857}\,142857\,142857\,\cdots
\]
repeats after 6 digits.  Since $2007 =
334\times6+3$ the $2007^{\textrm{th}}$ digit is the same as the
$3^{\textrm{rd}}$, which happens to be a $2$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I2.5)}]

Yes these are the same sets.  Both sets consist of all positive real
numbers: since they contain exactly the same numbers, they are the
same sets.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I2.6)}]

$100x = 31.313131\cdots = 31+x \implies 99x = 31 \implies x =
\frac{31}{99}$.

Similarly, $1000y = 273 + y$ so $y= \frac{273}{999}$.

In $z$ the initial ``$2$'' is not part of the repeating pattern, so
subtract it:  $z = 0.2 + 0.0154154154\cdots$.  Now let
$w=0.0154154154\cdots$.  You get $1000w = 15.4+w = 15\frac25 + w =
\frac{77}{5}+w$. Therefore $w= \frac{77}{5\times 999}$.
From this you get
\[
z = \tfrac15+w = \tfrac15 +  \frac{77}{5\times999} = \frac{1076}{4995}.
\]

\item[{\bfseries(I7.1)}]

  They are the same function.  Both are defined for all real numbers,
  and both will square whatever number you give them, so they are the

Let $x$ be any number.  Then, $f(x)$, if it is defined, is the largest

\item[{\bfseries(I7.6)}]

The domain of $k^{-1} $ is $(0, \infty)$, and $k^{-1}(x) = -\sqrt{x}$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.8a)}]

False: Since $\arcsin x$ is only defined if $-1\leq x\leq 1$ and hence
not for \emph{all} $x$, it is not true that $\sin\bigl(\arcsin
x\bigr) = x$ for \emph{all} real numbers $x$.
However, it is true that $\sin(\arcsin x) = x$ for all $x$ in
the interval $[-1,1]$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.8b)}]

$\arcsin(\sin x)$ is defined for all $x$ since $\sin x$ is
defined for all $x$, and $\sin x$ is always between $-1$ and $1$.
However the arcsine function always returns a number (angle) between
$-\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$, so $\arcsin( \sin x) = x$ can't be true when
$x>\pi/2$ or $x<-\pi/2$.  For $|x|\leq \pi/2$ it is true that $\arcsin
\sin x = x$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.8c)}]

Again, not true: if $x=\pi/2$ then $\tan x$ is not defined and therefore
$\arctan(\tan x)$ is not defined either.


Apart from that, $\arctan (\text{anything})$ always lies
between $-\pi/2 $ and $+\pi/2$, so $\arctan(\tan x)$ cannot
be the same as $x$ if either $x>\pi/2$ or $x<-\pi/2$.
\bigskip

True.

Set $x=0$ in $f(2x+3) = x^2$ and you find $f(3) = 0^2 = 0$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.14c)}]

Solve $2x+3 = \pi$ for $x$:  $x=\frac{\pi-3}{\pi}$.  Substitute this in $f(2x+3) =
x^2$ and you find $f(\pi) = \bigl(\frac{\pi-3}{2}\bigr)^2$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.14d)}]

Solve $2x+3 = t$ for $x$:  $x=\frac{t-3}{2}$.  Substitute this in $f(2x+3) =

\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.14e)}]

From the previous problem we know what $f(t)$ is for any $t$ so just substitute $t=x$:
$f(x)= b\bigl(\frac{x-3}{2}\bigr)^2$.

\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.15a)}]

We know $f\bigl(\frac1{x+1}\bigr) = 2x-12$ for all $x$, so if we want to know
$f(1)$ then we have to find an $x$ with $\frac{1}{x+1} = 1$.  Solving $\frac{1}{x+1} = 1$
for $x$ you find $x=0$. Substitute $x=0$ in $f\bigl(\frac1{x+1}\bigr) = 2x-12$
and you get $f(1) = 2\times0-12 = -12$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.15b)}]

To find $f(0)$ you proceed as above, this time solving $\frac{1}{x+1} = 0$ for
$x$.  In this case there is no solution $x$, and therefore the equation
$f\bigl(\frac1{x+1}\bigr) = 2x-12$ does not tell us what $f(0)$ is.  Conclusion:
either 0 is not in the domain of $f$, or we cannot tell what $f(0)$ is from
the  information provided in the problem.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.15c)}]

To find $f(t)$ you do the same as when you want to find $f(1)$.
We know $f\bigl(\frac1{x+1}\bigr) = 2x-12$ for all $x$, so if we want to know
$f(t)$ then we have to find an $x$ with $\frac{1}{x+1} = t$.  Solving $\frac{1}{x+1} = t$
for $x$ you find $x=\frac 1t -1$. Substitute $x=\frac 1t -1$ in $f\bigl(\frac1{x+1}\bigr) = 2x-12$
and you get $f(t) = 2\times\bigl(\frac{1}{t}-1\bigr)-12 = \frac{2}{t} -14 $.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.15d)}]

$f(2f(x)) = \frac{2}{2f(x)} - 14 = \frac{1}{f(x)} - 14 =
\frac{1}{\frac{2}{x}-14} - 14$.  You could simplify this if you wanted to, but
that was not part of the question.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.15e)}]

After finding $f(t) = \frac{2}{t} -14 $ you can substitute $t=x$ and you find
$f(x) = \frac{2}{x} -14 $.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.15f)}]

$f(2) = \frac{2}{2}-14 = -13 $ and therefore $f(f(2)) = f(-13) = \frac{2}{-13}-14 = -14\frac2{13} $.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.16)}]

No.  For instance if you set $x=1$ you get $f(1) = 1+1=2$, and if you set
$x=-1$ then you get $f((-1)^2) = (-1)+1$, i.e.\ $f(1) = 0$.  But $f(1)$
can't be equal to both $2$ and $0$, the formula $f(x^2) = x+1$ cannot be
true for all real numbers $x$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I7.18)}]

$g(x) = -2\bigl(x^2-2x\bigr)
= -2\bigl(x^2-2x+1 -1\bigr)
= -2\bigl[(x-1)^2 -1\bigr]
=-2(x-1)^2 + 2$, so the range of $g$ is $(-\infty, 2]$.

Alternatively:


$y = g(x) \iff y = -2x^2+4x \iff 2x^2-4x+y = 0$.
The quadratic formula says that the solutions are
\[
  x= \frac{4\pm\sqrt{16-8y}} {4}.
\]
If $16-8y<0$ then there are no solutions and $y$ does
not belong to the range of $g$.

If $16-8y\geq0$ then there is at least one solution
and  $y$ does belong to the range of $g$.


Conclusion, the range of $g$ consists of all $y$ with
$16-8y\geq 0$, i.e.~ all $y\leq2$.

(a) $A(x)$ is an area so it has units square inch and $x$ is
measured in inches, so $\dfrac{dA}{dx}$ is measured in
$\displaystyle\frac{\text{inch}^2}{\text{inch}} = \text{inch}$.

\input ../figures/221/02triangleareagrowth.tex

(b) Hint: The extra area $\Delta A$ that you get when the side of
an equilateral triangle grows from $x$ to $x+\Delta x$ can be
split into a thin parallelogram and a very tiny triangle.  Ignore
the area of the tiny triangle since the area of the parallelogram
will be much larger.  What is the area of this parallelogram?




The area of a parallelogram is ``base time height'' so here it is
$h\times\Delta x$, where $h$ is the height of the triangle.




Conclusion: $\displaystyle \frac{\Delta A}{\Delta x}
\approx\frac{h\Delta x}{\Delta x} = h$.




The derivative is therefore the height of the triangle.

\item[{\bfseries(III4.3)}]

The equation \eqref{eq:derivative-defined-first-time} already
contains a function $f$, but that is not the right function.  In
\eqref{eq:derivative-defined-first-time} $\Delta x$ is the variable,

want $\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}g(\Delta x)$.

$\delta = \varepsilon/2$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(III4.5)}]

$\delta = \min \bigl\{1, \frac16\varepsilon\bigr\}$
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(III4.6)}]

$|f(x) - (-7) |=|x^2-7x+10| = |x-2|\cdot|x-5| $.  If you choose
$\delta\leq 1$ then $|x-2|<\delta$ implies $1<x<3$, so that $|x-5|$
is at most $|1-5| = 4$.
So, choosing $\delta\leq 1$ we always have $|f(x) - L|<4|x-2|$ and
$|f(x) - L|<\varepsilon$ will follow from $|x-2|<\frac14\varepsilon$.
Our choice is then: $\delta = \min \bigl\{1, \frac14\varepsilon
\bigr\}$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(III4.7)}]
 $f(x) = x^3$, $a=3$, $L=27$.

When $x=3$ one has $x^3=27$, so $x^3-27=0$ for $x=3$.  Therefore you
can factor out $x-3$ from $x^3-27$ by doing a long division.  You get
$x^3-27 = (x-3)(x^2+3x+9)$, and thus
\[
|f(x) - L| = |x^3-27| =|x^2+3x+9|\cdot|x-3|.
\]
Never choose $\delta>1$.  Then $|x-3|<\delta$ will imply $2<x<4$ and
therefore
\[
|x^2+3x+9| \leq 4^2+3\cdot4+9 = 37.
\]
So if we always choose $\delta\leq 1$, then we will always have
\[
|x^3-27|\leq 37\delta \quad\text{for}\quad |x-3|<\delta.
\]
Hence, if we choose $\delta=\min\left\{ 1, \tfrac1{37}\varepsilon
\right\}$ then $|x-3|<\delta$ guarantees $|x^3-27| < \varepsilon$.


\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(III4.9)}]

$f(x) = \sqrt x$, $a=4$, $L=2$.
You have
\[
\sqrt x - 2 = \frac{(\sqrt x-2)(\sqrt x +2)}{\sqrt x +2}
=\frac{x-4}{\sqrt x+2}
\]
and therefore
\begin{equation}\label{eq:03sol-fx-L-estimate}
  |f(x) - L | = \frac{1}{\sqrt x+2}|x-4|.
\end{equation}
Once again it would be nice if we could replace $1/(\sqrt x + 2)$ by
a constant, and we achieve this by always choosing $\delta\leq 1$.
If we do that then for $|x-4|<\delta$ we always have $3<x<5$ and
hence
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt x+2} < \frac{1}{\sqrt 3 +2},
\]
since $1/(\sqrt x+ 2)$ increases as you decrease $x$.

So, if we always choose $\delta\leq 1$ then $|x-4|<\delta$ guarantees
\[
|f(x)-2| < \frac1{\sqrt3 +2}|x-4|,
\]
which prompts us to choose $\delta = \min\left\{ 1, (\sqrt
  3+2)\varepsilon \right\}$.

\textbf{A smarter solution:} We \emph{can} replace $1/(\sqrt x +2)$
by a constant in \eqref{eq:03sol-fx-L-estimate}, because for all $x$
in the domain of $f$ we have $\sqrt x \geq0$, which implies
\[
\frac1{\sqrt x+ 2} \leq \frac 12.
\]
Therefore $|\sqrt x- 2| \leq \frac12|x-4|$, and we could choose
$\delta = 2\varepsilon$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(III4.10)}]

Hints:
\[
\sqrt{x+6}-3 = \frac{x+6-9}{\sqrt{x+6} + 3} = \frac{x-3}{\sqrt{x+6} +
  3}
\]
so
\[
|\sqrt{x+6} - 3|\leq \tfrac13 |x-3|.
\]
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(III4.11)}]

We have
\[
\left|\frac{1+x}{4+x} - \frac{1}{2}\right| =
\left|\frac{x-2}{4+x}\right|.
\]
If we choose $\delta\le1$ then $|x-2|<\delta$ implies $1<x<3$ so that
\[
\underline{\frac17 <\;}{\text{we don't care}} \frac{1}{4+x} <
\frac15.
\]
Therefore
\[
\left|\frac{x-2}{4+x}\right| < \tfrac15 |x-2|,
\]
so if we want $|f(x) - \tfrac12| <\varepsilon$ then we must require
$|x-2|< 5\varepsilon$.  This leads us to choose
\[
\delta = \min\left\{ 1, 5\varepsilon \right\}.
\]

False!  Here's an example: $f(x) = \frac1x$ and $g(x) = x-\frac1x$.

False again, as shown by the example $f(x) = g(x) = \frac1x$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(III14.21a)}]

False, for the following reason:  $g(x)$ is the difference of $f(x)+g(x)$ and
$f(x)$.  If $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ exists and $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) + g(x)$ also exists, then

\item[{\bfseries(III16.18)}]

Note that the limit is for \(x\to\infty\)!  As \(x\) goes to
infinity \(\sin x\) oscillates up and down between \(-1\) and
\(+1\).  Dividing by \(x\) then gives you a quantity which goes to
zero.  To give a good proof you use the Sandwich Theorem like this:
\smallskip

Since \(-1\le \sin x\le 1\) for all \(x\) you have
\[
\frac{-1}{x} \le \frac{\sin x}{x} \le \frac{1}{x}.
\]
Since both \(-1/x\) and \(1/x\) go to zero as \(x\to\infty\) the
function in the middle must also go to zero.  Hence
\[
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 0.

This is not a rational function, but you can use the same trick:  factor out the

 = \frac{x}{x^2} \frac{1}{\frac{\cos x}{x^2} + 1}.
\]
Using the Sandwich Theorem as in the previous problems you get
$\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{\cos x}{x^2} = 0$.  With the limit properties you then
get
\begin{align*}
  \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{x}{\cos x + x^2}
 &= \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{x}{x^2} \frac{1}{\frac{\cos x}{x^2} + 1}\\

10^\circ = \frac{10}{360}\times2\pi \textrm{radians} = \frac{\pi}{18}.
\]
You get
\[
\sin 10^\circ \approx \frac{\pi}{18},
\]
\[
\cos 10^\circ \approx 1 - \frac{\pi^2}{2\times18^2}.
\]
You don't have a calculator, so, had this been 1965, you would have
enthusiastically computed these numbers by hand (to two decimals).

For a really rough estimate assume $\pi\approx3$, to get
\[
10^\circ \approx \frac{3}{18} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.17,
\]
\[
\tan 10^\circ \approx \sin 10^\circ \approx \frac{3}{18} = \frac{1}{6} \approx
0.17,
\]
\begin{align*}
  \cos 10^\circ &\approx 1 - \frac{1}{2} \bigl(\frac{1}{6}\bigr)^2\\
  &= 1- \frac{1}{72}\\
  &\approx 1-0.014 = 0.986
\end{align*}
To find the other expressions, use $\sin(\frac\pi2+\theta) =
\cos\theta$ and $100^\circ = 90^\circ + 10 ^\circ$.

$\sin 100^\circ = \cos10^\circ \approx -0.986 $

$\cos 190^\circ = -\cos 10^\circ \approx -0.986$

$\tan80^\circ = \bigl(\tan 10^\circ\bigr)^{-1} \approx 6$ .

No.  As \(x\to0\) the quantity \(\sin \frac{1}{x}\) oscillates
between \(-1\) and \(+1\) and does not converge to any particular
value.  Therefore, no matter how you choose \(k\), it will never be
true that \(\lim_{x\to 0} \sin \frac1x = k\), because the limit
doesn't exist.

\item[{\bfseries(III18.5)}]

We are given that
\[
\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x) - mx-n = 0.
\]
Adding $n$ to both sides gives us
\[
\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x) -mx = n,
\]
which is the formula for $n$ we had to prove.

To get the formula for $m$ we multiply with
\[
\lim_{x\to\infty} 1/x =
0
\]
and use the limit properties:
\begin{multline*}
  \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{f(x)-mx-n}{x} = \\
  \bigl(\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)-mx-n\bigr)\times
  \bigl(\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{1}{x}\bigr)=\\
  0\times0 = 0.
\end{multline*}
Work out the left hand side:
\[
0 = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{f(x)}{x} - m - \frac{n}{x}.
\]
This implies
\[
0 = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{f(x)}{x} - m
\]
and thus
\[
\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{f(x)}{x} = m.

$V(t) = f(S(t))$ so the chain rule says $V'(t) = f'(S(t)) S'(t)$




$V(t) = S(t)^3$ so the chain rule says $V'(t) = 3S(t)^2 S'(t)$




$V=S^3$ so the chain rule says $\dfrac{dV}{dt} =

\textbf{(d)} We are given $V(t) = 8$, and $V'(t)=2$.  Since $V=S^3$
we get $S=2$.  From (c) we know $V'(t)=3S(t)^2 S'(t)$, so $2 =

If the distance between the bottom of the pole and the wall is $x(t)$,
and if the angle between the pole and the floor is $\theta(t)$, then
$x(t) = 10 \cos \theta(t)$.  This is true at all times so we are
allowed to differentiate the equation, which then leads to
\[
\frac{\dd x} {\dd t} = -10\sin\theta \frac{\dd \theta} {\dd t}.
\]
When the angle is $\pi/4$ we know that $\frac{\dd x} {\dd t} = +7$ feet$/$sec.
Therefore
\[
\frac{\dd \theta} {\dd t}

This is the situation:

Let $h(t)$ be the height of the rocket at time $t$.  Then the distance between
camera and rocket (let's call it $D$) and the angle $\theta$ satisfy
\[
h^2+ (4000)^2 = D^2, \qquad
\frac{h} {4000} = \tan \theta.
\]
This is true at all times, so we can differentiate these equations, which gives us
\[
2h\frac{\dd h} {\dd t} = 2D\frac{\dd D} {\dd t},
\text{ and }
\frac{1} {4000}\frac{\dd h} {\dd t}
= \frac{1} {\cos^2\theta} \frac{\dd\theta} {\dd t}.
\]
We are given that when $h=3000$ we have $\frac{\dd h} {\dd t} = 600$.
By Pythagoras, we then also know $D=\sqrt{3000^2 + 4000^2} = 5000$,
and $\cos \theta = \frac{4000} {5000} = \frac{4} {5}$.
Therefore
\[
\frac{\dd D} {\dd t}
= \frac{h} {D}\frac{\dd h} {\dd t}
= \frac{3} {5}\times 600
= 360  \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{sec},

\[

First, what is the area of an isosceles triangle whose sides and opening
angle you know?  This is not a formula you should memorize.  Instead try
figuring it out.  Here is the drawing:
\begin{center}
  \input ../figures/221/04problem-expandingisoscelestriangle.pdf_tex
\end{center}
The area is $\frac12 \mathsf{width}\times\mathsf{height}$, i.e.
\[
A(t)
= \mathsf{Area}
= \frac12 \times 2 \times2\sin\theta
= 2\sin\theta \; \mathsf{in}^2.
\]
This is true at all times, so we are allowed to differentiate, resulting in
\[
\frac{\dd A} {\dd t} = 2\cos \theta \frac{\dd \theta} {\dd t}.
\]
We know that $\frac{\dd A} {\dd t} = 0.5 \text{in}^2/\text{sec}$.
When $\theta=60^\circ$ we also know $\cos \theta = \frac{1} {2}$, and hence
\[
0.5 = 2\times\frac{1} {2} \times \frac{\dd \theta} {\dd t}
\text{ and thus }
\frac{\dd \theta} {\dd t} = 0.5 \mathsf{rad}/\mathsf{sec}.

If $x(t)$ is the $x$ coordinate of the point $P$, then
$\DS \frac{10} {x} = \tan \theta(t)$, or,
\[
10 = x\cdot \tan \theta.
\]
This is true at all times, so we may differentiate both sides
of the equation, resulting in
\[
0 = x \frac{1} {\cos^2\theta}\frac{\dd\theta} {\dd t} + \frac{\dd x} {\dd t}\tan \theta.
\]
When $\theta=\pi/3$ we have $\tan\theta = \sqrt{3}$ so $x=10/\sqrt{3}{\rm ft}$.
We are also given that $\frac{\dd x} {\dd t} = -3 {\rm ft}/{\rm sec}$
(note the minus, which
is there because the point $P$ is moving to the \emph{left}).
When $\theta=\pi/3$ we also have $\cos \theta = \frac12$.
We are led to the following equation
\[
0 = \frac{10} {\sqrt{3}} \frac{1} {(\frac12)^2} \frac{\dd \theta} {\dd t}
+ (-3) \sqrt{3},
\]
which implies
\[
 \frac{\dd \theta} {\dd t}

The situation is thus:
\begin{center}
  \input ../figures/221/04problem-dopplerpolice.pdf_tex
\end{center}
The distance from the car to the police officer is $D(t)$.
The distance along the road from the car to the nearest point to the officer
on the road is $s(t)$.  The speed of the car (which we want to know) is $s'(t)$.
The Doppler radar measures the rate at which $D(t)$ is changing.

The relation between $D(t)$ and $s(t)$ is
\[
D^2 = s^2 + (10)^2.
\]
This is true at all times so we are allowed to differentiate the relation,
which leads to
\[
2D \frac{\dd D} {\dd t} = 2s\frac{\dd s} {\dd t}
\text{ and therefore }
\frac{\dd s} {\dd t} = \frac{D} {s} \frac{\dd D} {\dd t}.
\]
Given is that at some moment $D=20$, and $\frac{\dd D} {\dd t} = -30$
(negative because the car is moving toward the officer).
``Pythagoras'' says that $s = \sqrt{D^2-(10)^2} = \sqrt{300} = 10\surd 3$.
Therefore
\[
\frac{\dd s} {\dd t} = \frac{30} {10\surd 3} \times(-30) =
-30\surd 3\; \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{sec}.
\]

Note : the phrasing of the problem is ambiguous since ``20 feet away'' could
also be taken to mean that $s=20$ when the police officer measures the car's
speed. In that case the above computation still is valid, except at the end
one must substitute $s=20$, $D = \sqrt{(20)^2 + (10)^2} = 10\surd 5$.
This leads to
$\frac{\dd s} {\dd t} = \frac{10\surd 5} {20}\times(-30) = -15\surd 5$ m$/$sec.

$=1$'' implies that one has $\theta = (1/R)-2$.  Hence the area
will be $A(R) =\theta R^2 = R^2\bigl( (1/R)-2 )\bigr) = R-2R^2$.
Thus the area is maximal when $R=\frac14$, and hence
$\theta=2$radians.  Again we note that this answer is reasonable
because values of $\theta>2\pi$ don't make sense, but $\theta=2$
does.

\textbf{(a)} The intensity at $x$ is a function of $x$.  Let's
call it $I(x)$.  Then at $x$ the distance to the big light is
$x$, and the distance to the smaller light is $1000-x$. Therefore
\[
  I(x) = \frac{1000}{x^2} + \frac{125}{(1000-x)^2}
\]
\textbf{(b)} Find the minimum of $I(x)$ for $0<x<1000$.
\[
  I'(x) = -2000 x^{-3} + 250(1000 - x)^{-3}.
\]
$I'(x) = 0$ has one solution, namely, $x= \frac{1000}{3}$.
By looking at the signs of $I'(x)$ you see that $I(x)$ must have a
minimum.  If you don't like looking at signs, you could instead
look at the second derivative
\[
  I''(x) = 6000 x^{-4} + 750 (1000 - x)^{-4}
\]

The soup can is made of two disks (the top and bottom) and the side.
Both top and bottom have area $\pi r^2$.
The side can be made by bending a rectangular piece of metal into
a cylinder.  The sides of the rectangular piece of metal needed for
this are $h$ (height of the cylinder) and $2\pi r$ (perimeter of
the cylinder).  Therefore the total area of the metal that is needed
to make a cylinder of height $h$ and radius $r$ is
\[
A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh = 100 \mathsf{in}^2.
\]
The volume of that cylinder is
\[
V = \text{area base} \times \text{height} = \pi r^2h.
\]
We have to choose which variable we use to distinguish the different
sizes of cans that we can make.  The variables at hand are $r$
and $h$.  If we choose $h$ then we would have to get rid of $r$,
which involves solving the equation $A=100$ for $r$.  That equation
is quadratic, and formula for $r$ will involve square roots.




The other choice is the variable $r$.  Then we have to eliminate $h$,
i.e.~solve $A=100$ for $h$.  The solution is
\[
2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh = 100 \implies
h = \frac{100 - 2\pi r^2} {2\pi r}.

The Riemann-sum is the total area of the rectangles, so to get the
smallest Riemann-sum you must make the rectangles as small as
possible.  You can't change their widths, but you can change their
heights by changing the $c_i$.  To get the smallest area we make the
heights as small as possible. So, for the \emph{smallest} possible
Riemann sum choose  $c_i$ to be the point in the interval $[x_i,
x_{i+1}]$ where $f(x)$ attains its minimum.

For the largest possible Riemann sum choose each $c_i$ to be the point
in $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ where $f(x)$ is maximal.

In this example this means you should choose:  $c_1 = x_1$, $c_2$ somewhere
between $x_1$ and $x_2$ where $f$ has its maximum, $c_3=x_2$, $c_4=x_3$,
$c_5=x_4$, and $c_6 = x_5$.

The answer we got in part (a) is defined for all $q\neq \pm1$, but it
is not valid for all those values of $q$.  Here's why:

The integral in part (a) is over the interval $-q<x<q$ and the
function that is being integrated is not defined at $x=\pm1$, so those
values of $x$ should not lie in the integration interval.  Therefore
only $-1<q<1$ is allowed.

\textbf{(a)} The first derivative of $\erf(x)$ is, by definition
\[
\erf'(x) = \frac2{\sqrt{\pi}}e^{-x^2},
\]
so you get the second derivative by differentiating this:
\[
\erf''(x) = \frac{-4x}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{-x^2}.
\]
This is negative when $x>0$, and positive when $x<0$ so the graph of
$\erf(x)$ has an inflection point at $x=0$.

\textbf{(b)} Wikipedia is not wrong. Let's figure out what sign
$\erf(-1)$ has (for instance).  By definition you have
\[
\erf(-1) =\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^{-1}e^{-t^2}dt.
\]
Note that in this integral the upper bound ($-1$) is less than the
lower bound ($0$).  To fix that we switch the upper and lower
integration bounds, which introduces a minus sign:
\[
\erf(-1) = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{-1}^0 e^{-t^2} dt.
\]
The integral we have here is positive because it's an integral of a
positive function from a smaller number to a larger number, i.e. it
is of the form $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ with $f(x)\ge0$ and with $a<b$.

With the minus sign that makes $\erf(-1)$ negative.
