\chapter{Exponentials and Logarithms (naturally)}
\label{ch:exponentials}
% !!! Issue: Limits of sequences are assumed here, but are not defined anywhere
In this chapter we first recall some facts about exponentials ($x^y$ with $x>0$
and $y$ arbitrary): they should be familiar from algebra, or ``precalculus''.
What is new is perhaps the definition of $x^y$ when $y$ is not a rational
number: for example, we know that $2^{3/4}$ is the 4th root of the third power
of 2 ($\sqrt[4]{2^3}$), but what should we take as the definition of something
like $2^{\sqrt{2}}$?

Next we ask ``what is the derivative of $f(x)=a^x$?'' The answer leads us to the
famous number $e\approx 2.718\, 281\, 828\, 459\, 045\, 235\, 360\, 287\, 471\,
352\, 662\, 497\, 757\, 247\, 093\, 699\, 95\cdots$.

Finally, we compute the derivative of $f(x)=\log_a x$, and we discuss the notion
of ``exponential growth''.


\section{Exponents} %{{{1
Here we discuss the definition of $x^y$ when $x$ and $y$ are arbitrary
real numbers, with $x>0$.




For any real number $x$ and any positive integer $n=1, 2, 3, \ldots$ one defines
\[
x^n = \overbrace{x\cdot x\cdot \cdots \cdot x}^{\text{$n$ times}}
\]
and, if $x\neq0$,
\[
x^{-n} = \frac1{x^n}.
\]
One defines $x^0=1$ for any $x\ne0$.




To define $x^{p/q}$ for a general fraction $\frac p q$ one must assume
that the number $x$ is positive. One then defines
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pqpowerofx-def}
  x^{p/q}= \sqrt[q]{x^p}.
\end{equation}
This does not tell us how to define $x^a$ is the exponent $a$ is not a fraction.
One can define $x^a$ for irrational numbers $a$ by taking limits.  For example,
to define $2^{\sqrt{2}}$, we look at the sequence of numbers obtained by truncating
the decimal expansion of $\sqrt{2}$, namely
\[
a_1 = 1,
\qquad   a_2= 1.4=\tfrac{14}{10},
\qquad    a_3=1.41=\tfrac{141}{100},
\qquad a_4= 1.414=\tfrac{1414}{1000},
\qquad   \cdots.
\]
Each $a_n$ is a rational number, so we know what $2^{a_n}$ is; for example,
$2^{a_4} = \sqrt[1000]{2^{1414}}$.  Our definition of $2^{\sqrt{2}}$ then is
\[
2^{\sqrt{ 2}} = \lim_{n\to\infty} 2^{a_n},
\]
which is to say, we define $2^{\sqrt{2}}$ as the ``limit of the sequence''
\[
2, \sqrt[10]{2^{14}}, \sqrt[100]{2^{141}}, \sqrt[1000]{2^{1414}}, \cdots
\]
(See table \ref{tbl:07twototheroottwo}.)

numbers $x$.  Note that as $x$ gets closer to $\sqrt2$ the quantity
$2^x$ appears to converge to some number.  This limit is our
definition of $2^{\sqrt{2}}$.}
  \label{tbl:07twototheroottwo}
\end{table}%








Here one ought to prove that this limit exists, and that its value does not
depend on the particular choice of numbers $a_n$ tending to $a$. We will not go
into these details in this course.




In precalculus you learn that the exponential functions satisfy the
following properties:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:exponential-properties}
  x^a x^b = x^{a+b}, \qquad
  \dfrac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}, \qquad
  \bigl(x^a\bigr)^b = x^{ab}
\end{equation}
provided $a$ and $b$ are rational numbers. In fact these properties still
hold if $a$ and $b$ are arbitrary real numbers. Again, we
won't go through the proofs here.




Now instead of considering $x^a$ as a function of $x$ we can pick a positive
number $a$ and consider the function $f(x) = a^x$. This function is defined for
all real numbers $x$ (as long as the base $a$ is positive.).




\subsection{The trouble with powers of negative numbers. } %{{{2
The cube root of a negative number is well defined.  For instance,
$\sqrt[3]{-8}=-2$ because $(-2)^3 = -8$.  In view of the definition
\eqref{eq:pqpowerofx-def} of $x^{p/q}$ we can write this as
\[
(-8)^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{(-8)^1} = \sqrt[3]{-8} = -2.
\]
But there is a problem: since $\frac{2}{6}=\frac13$ we might think that
$(-8)^{2/6} = (-8)^{1/3}$.  However our definition \eqref{eq:pqpowerofx-def}
tells us that
\[
(-8)^{2/6} = \sqrt[6]{(-8)^2} = \sqrt[6]{+64} =  +2.
\]
Another example:
\[
(-4)^{1/2} = \sqrt{-4} \text{ is not defined}
\]
but, even though $\frac12=\frac24$,
\[
(-4)^{2/4} = \sqrt[4]{(-4)^2}  = \sqrt[4]{+16} = 2 \text{ is defined.}
\]

There are two ways out of this mess: either
\begin{enumerate}\sffamily\itshape
\item avoid taking fractional powers of negative numbers, or
\item whenever we compute $x^{p/q}$, we first simplify the fraction by removing
  common divisors of $p$ and $q$.
\end{enumerate}
The safest option is just not to take fractional powers of negative numbers.




Given that fractional powers of negative numbers cause all these
headaches it is not surprising that we didn't try to define $x^a$ for
negative $x$ if $a$ is irrational.  For example, $(-8)^\pi$ is not
defined\footnote{There is a definition of $(-8)^\pi$ which uses complex
numbers, but we won't see or need this in the calculus sequence; it
will show up in math 319 or 320 where complex exponentials are
treated, and you will also run into $(-8)^\pi$ if you take an
electrical engineering course where ``phasors'' are discussed}.



\section{Logarithms} %{{{1
Briefly, if $a$ is a positive constant not equal to 1, then we define $y=\log_a
x$ to be the inverse function to $y=a^x$. This means that, by definition,
\[
y=\log_a x \iff x=a^y.
\]
In other words, $\log_a x$ is the answer to the question ``for which number $y$
does one have $x=a^y$?''  The number $\log_a x$ is called \emph{the logarithm of
$x$ to the base $a$}.  Note that since exponentials are always positive, the
logarithm of 0 or of a negative number is not defined\footnote{Again, there is a
way to define logarithms of negative numbers using complex numbers. We will not
pursue these ideas at the moment.}


For instance,
\[
2^3 = 8, \quad
2^{1/2} = \sqrt2,\quad
2^{-1}= \frac12
\]
so
\[
\log_2 8 = 3,\quad
\log_2\bigl(\sqrt{2}\bigr) = \frac12,\quad
\log_2 \frac12 = -1.
\]
Also:
\[
\log_2 (-3) \text{ doesn't exist}
\]
because there is no number $y$ for which $2^y = -3$ ($2^y$ is always positive)
and
\[
\log_{-3}2 \text{ doesn't exist either}
\]
because $y=\log_{-3}2$ would have to be some real number which satisfies $(-3)^y
= 2$, and we don't take non-integer powers of negative numbers.






\section{Properties of logarithms} %{{{1
In general one has
\[
\log_a a^x = x,  \text{ and }  a^{\log_a x}=x.
\]
There is a subtle difference between these formulas: the first one holds for all
real numbers $x$, but the second only holds for $x>0$, since $\log _a x$ doesn't
make sense for $x\leq 0$.




Again, you learn the following formulas in precalculus:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \log_a xy &= \log_a x + \log _a y \\
    \log_a \frac xy &= \log_ax-\log_a y
  \end{aligned}
  \qquad\qquad
  \begin{aligned}
    \log_a x^y &= y\log_a x \\
    \log_a x &= \dfrac{\log_b x}{\log_b a}
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:07logarithm-properties}
\end{equation}
They follow from \eqref{eq:exponential-properties}, and to review this
subject it is good to write out the reason why $a^{p+q} = a^p a^q$
implies $\log_a xy = \log_a x + \log_a y$, and similarly for the other
formulas in \eqref{eq:07logarithm-properties}.




\section{Graphs of exponential functions and logarithms} %{{{1
Figure \ref{fig:07expplot} shows the graphs of some exponential
functions $y=a^x$ with different values of $a$, and Figure
\ref{fig:07logplot} shows the graphs of $y=\log_2 x$, $y=\log_3 x$,
$\log_{1/2}x$, $\log_{1/3}(x)$ and $y=\log_{10}x$.




\begin{figure}[t]\centering
  \input{../figures/221/07expplot.tex}
  \caption{The graphs of $y=2^x, 3^x, (1/2)^x, (1/3)^x$ and $y=(4/5)^x$.
    The graphs are purposely not labeled: can you figure out which is which?}
  \label{fig:07expplot}
\end{figure}




From precalculus we recall:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $a>1$ then $f(x)=a^x$ is an increasing function of $x$.
\item If $0<a<1$ then $f(x)=a^x$ is a decreasing function of $x$.
\end{itemize}
In other words, for $a>1$ it follows from $x_1<x_2$ that
$a^{x_1}<a^{x_2}$; if $0<a<1$, then $x_1<x_2$ implies $a^{x_1} >
a^{x_2}$.

These statements can be shown using the properties \ref{eq:exponential-properties}.  However, we might also try to show these properties by computing the derivatives of these functions.


\section{The derivative of $a^x$ and the definition of $e$} %{{{1
To begin, we try to differentiate the function $y=2^x$:
\begin{align*}
  \frac{d}{dx}\left[ 2^x \right]
  & = \lim_{\Delta x\to0}\frac{2^{x+\Delta x}-2^x}{\Delta x} \\
  & = \lim_{\Delta x\to0}\frac{2^{x}2^{\Delta x}-2^x}{\Delta x} \\
  & = \lim_{\Delta x\to0}2^x\frac{2^{\Delta x}-1}{\Delta x} \\
  & = 2^x \lim_{\Delta x\to0}\frac{2^{\Delta x}-1}{\Delta x}.
\end{align*}




So if we assume that the limit
\[
\lim_{\Delta x\to0}\frac{2^{\Delta x}-1}{\Delta x}=C
\]
exists, then we have
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:derivativeof2x}
  \frac{d 2^x}{dx} = C 2^x.
\end{equation}
On your calculator you can compute $\frac{2^{\Delta x}-1}{\Delta x}$
for smaller and smaller values of $\Delta x$, which leads you to
suspect that the limit actually does exist, and that $C\approx
0.693\;147\;\ldots$. One can in fact prove that the limit exists, but
we will not do this here.




\begin{figure}[!t]\centering
  \input{../figures/221/07logplot.tex}
  \caption{Graphs of some logarithms.  Each curve is the graph of a
    function $y=\log_a x$ for various values of $a>0$.  Can you tell
    what $a$ is for each graph?}
  \label{fig:07logplot}
\end{figure}








Once we know \eqref{eq:derivativeof2x} we can compute the derivative of $a^x$
for any other positive number $a$. To do this we write $a=2^{\log_2 a}$,
and hence
\[
a^x = \bigl( 2^{\log_2 a} \bigr)^x = 2^{x\cdot \log_2 a}.
\]
By the Chain Rule we therefore get
\begin{align*}
  \frac{da^x}{dx} &= \frac{d}{dx}\left[2^{x\cdot \log_2 a}\right] \\
  &= C\;2^{x\cdot \log_2 a}\; \frac{d}{dx}\left[x\cdot \log_2 a\right] \\
  &=C\;2^{x\cdot \log_2 a}\cdot \log_2 a \\
  &= (C\log_2 a) \;a^x.
\end{align*}
So the derivative of $a^x$ is just some constant times $a^x$, the constant being
$C\log_2a$.  This is essentially our formula for the derivative of $a^x$, but
one can make the formula look nicer by introducing a special number
\[
e=2^{1/C}\text{ where  }
C=\lim_{ \Delta x\to0} \frac{2^{ \Delta x} - 1}{ \Delta x}.
\]
One has
\[
e\approx 2.718\;281\;828\;459\;045\;\cdots
\]
The definition ``$e = 2^{1/C}$'' looks completely random and
unmotivated, but here is the reason why $e=2^{1/C}$ is a special
number: if you set $a=e$, then
\[
C\log_2 a = C\log_2 e = C\log_2 2^{1/C} = C\cdot \frac1C =1,
\]
and therefore the derivative of the function $y=e^x$ is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:derivative-of-ex}
  \frac{de^x}{dx} = e^x.
\end{equation}
Read that again: the function $e^x$ is its own derivative!




The logarithm with base $e$ is called the \emph{Natural Logarithm},
and is written
\[
\ln x = \log_e x.
\]
Thus we have
\begin{equation}
  e^{\ln x}  = x \qquad  \ln e^x = x
\end{equation}
where the second formula holds for all real numbers $x$ but the first one
only makes sense for $x>0$.




For any positive number $a$ we have $a=e^{\ln a}$, and also
\[
a^x = e^{x\ln a}.
\]
By the Chain Rule you then get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:derivative-of-ax}
  \dfrac{da^x}{dx} = a^x\ln a.
\end{equation}




\section{Derivatives of Logarithms} %{{{1
Since the logarithm $f(x)=\log_a x$ is the inverse function of the exponential
$g(x) = a^x$, we can find its derivative by implicit differentiation: we know
that
\[
a^{f(x)} = x.
\]
Differentiating both sides, and using the Chain Rule on the left gives
\[
(\ln a)  a^{f(x)} f'(x) = 1.
\]
Now solve for $f'(x)$ to get
\[
f'(x) = \frac{1}{(\ln a) a^{f(x)}}.
\]
Finally we remember that $a^{f(x)} = x$, and this gives us the derivative of $a^x$:
\[
\frac{da^x}{dx} = \frac{1}{x\ln a}.
\]
In particular, the natural logarithm has a very simple derivative: since $\ln
e=1$, we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:derivative-of-ln}
 \frac{d}{dx}\left[\ln x\right] = \frac{1}{x}.
\end{equation}


\section{Limits involving exponentials and logarithms} %{{{1
\begin{theorem}  Let $r$ be any real number.  Then, if $a>1$,
  \[
  \lim_{x\to\infty} x^r a^{-x} = 0,
  \]
  i.e.
  \[
  \lim_{x \to\infty}\frac{x^r}{a^x} = 0.
  \]
\end{theorem}
This theorem says that \textit{any exponential will beat any power of $x$ as
  $x\to\infty$}.  For instance, as $x \to\infty$ both $x^{1000}$ and $(1.001)^x$
go to infinity, but
\[
\lim_{x \to\infty} \frac{x^{1000}}{(1.001)^x} = 0,
\]
so, in the long run, for very large $x$, $1.001^x$ will be much larger than
$1000^x$.


% !!! Discuss: Instead we could just repeatedly use L'Hopital's rule at
% infinity. That proof is much less horrible.

% l'Hopital's rule was not proved for f/g where f, g\to\infty.
% The rule also encourages not thinking about "how large function are"
% Its use should be discouraged.  This section should be modified to include the
% list of functions in their natural magnitude
%               (log << powers of x << exponential functions)
%

\begin{proof}[Proof when $a=e$]
  We want to show $\lim_{x\to\infty} x^re^{-x} = 0$.  To do this consider the
  function $f(x) = x^{r+1}e^{-x}$.  Its derivative is
  \[
  f'(x) = \frac{dx^{r+1}e^{-x}}{dx}
  = \bigl((r+1)x^r - x^{r+1}\bigr)e^{-x}
  = (r+1-x)x^re^{-x}.
  \]
  Therefore $f'(x) < 0$ for $x>r+1$, i.e.\ $f(x)$ is decreasing for $x>r+1$.
  It follows that $f(x) <f(r+1)$ for all $x>r+1$, i.e.
  \[
  x^{r+1}e^{-x} < (r+1)^{r+1}e^{-(r+1)}\text{ for } x>r+1.
  \]
  Divide by $x$, abbreviate $A=(r+1)^{r+1}e^{-(r+1)}$, and we get
  \[
  0<x^re^{-x}<\frac Ax \text{ for all }x>r+1.
  \]
  The Sandwich Theorem implies that $\lim_{x\to\infty} x^re^{-x} = 0$, which
  is what we had promised to show.

The case with general $a$ follows after a substitution:  given $a$ we set 
\[
 x=\frac{t}{\ln a}. 
\]
Then, since $a>1$ we have $\ln a>0$ so that as $x\to\infty$ one also has $t\to\infty$.  Therefore
\[
 \lim_{x\to\infty}
 \frac{x^r}{a^x}
 = 
 \lim_{x\to\infty}
 \frac{x^r}{e^{x\ln a}}
 = 
 \lim_{t\to\infty}
 \frac{(t/\ln a)^r}{e^{t}}
 = \underbrace{(\ln a)^{-r}}_{\textsf{constant}}\cdot 
 \underbrace{\lim_{t\to\infty}
 \frac{t^r}{e^{t}}}_{=0}
 =0.
\]


\end{proof}




\subsection{Related limits} %{{{2
If $a$, $m$, and $r$ are constants, then
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    a>1 \implies &
    \lim_{x \to\infty} \frac{a^x}{x^r} = \infty \quad(D.N.E.)
    \label{eq:07exp-beats-power-limit}\\
    m>0 \implies & \lim_{x \to\infty} \frac{\ln x}{x^m} =0
        \label{eq:07power-beats-log-atinfty-limit}\\
    m>0 \implies & \lim_{x \to 0} x^m\ln x =0
        \label{eq:07power-beats-log-atzero-limit}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
The second limit (\ref{eq:07power-beats-log-atinfty-limit}) says that even
though $\ln x$ becomes infinitely large as $x \to\infty$, it is always much less
than any power $x^m$ with $m>0$ real.  To prove it you set $x=e^t$ and then
$t=s/m$, which leads to
\[
\lim_{x \to\infty} \frac{\ln x}{x^m}
\;\stackrel{x=e^t}{=}\;
\lim_{t \to\infty} \frac{t}{e^{mt}}
\;\stackrel{t = s/m}{=}\;
\frac1m\;\lim_{t \to\infty}\frac{s}{e^s} = 0.
\]
The limit (\ref{eq:07power-beats-log-atzero-limit}) follows from the second by
substituting $x=1/y$ and using $\ln\frac1x = -\ln x$.




\section{Exponential growth and decay} %{{{1
\subsection{Absolute and relative growth rates} %{{{2
If a quantity $X(t)$ changes with time, then the change in $X$ during a short
time interval of length $\Delta t$ is
\[
\Delta X = X(t+\Delta t) - X(t).
\]
If $X$ is measured in certain units, then the change $\Delta X$ has
the same units as $X$.  The change $\Delta X$ is sometimes called the
\emph{absolute change}, to distinguish it from the \emph{relative
  change,} which is defined as
\[
\text{Relative change in $X$ }= \frac{\Delta X} {X}.
\]
No matter what units $X$ is measured in, the relative change has no
units and can be expressed as a percentage.  For instance, if the
population $X$ of a city increases from $200,000$ to $250,000$
(people), then the absolute population change is $50,000$ (people),
but the relative population change is
\[
\frac{50,000\text{ people}}
{200,000\text{ people}} =
\frac{1} {4} = 25\%.
\]
Just as we defined the rate of change of a quantity $X(t)$ to be
\[
\frac{dX} {dt} = \lim_{\Delta t\to0} \frac{\Delta X} {\Delta t},
\]
we define the \emph{relative rate of change} or \emph{relative growth
  rate} to be
\[
\lim_{\Delta t \to 0}
\frac{\left\{
    \parbox{90pt}{\sffamily\centering%
      Relative change in $X$\\
      from $t$ to $t+\Delta t$ }
  \right\}} {\Delta t}
= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta X} {X \Delta t}
= \frac{1} {X}\frac{dX} {dt}.
\]




\subsection{Theorem on constant relative growth} %{{{2
\label{sec:07const-relative-growth}
\itshape%
Suppose that a time-dependent quantity $X(t)$ has a constant relative
growth rate, meaning that
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1} {X} \frac{dX} {dt} = k \text{ is constant.}
  \label{eq:07constant-relative-growth}
\end{equation}
And suppose that at time $t_0$ the value of $X$ is known to be
$X(t_0) = X_0$.  Then
\begin{equation}\label{eq:07exponentialgrowth}
  X(t) = X_0 e^{k(t-t_0)}.
\end{equation}
\upshape



% !!! Issue: The proof assumes the result that a function with zero derivative is constant! This does not appear in the text anywhere.
\begin{proof}
  The constant relative growth rate condition
  \eqref{eq:07constant-relative-growth} implies
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:07exp-growth-diffeq}
    \frac{dX(t)}{dt} = kX(t).
  \end{equation}
  The trick is to look at the rate of change of $e^{-kt}X(t)$:
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{dX(t)e^{-kt}}{dt}
    &=X(t)\frac{de^{-kt}}{dt} + \frac{dX(t)}{dt}e^{-kt}\\
    &=-kX(t) e^{-kt}+X'(t)e^{-kt}\\
    &= (X'(t) - kX(t))e^{-kt} \\
    &=0.
  \end{align*}
  In other words $X(t)e^{-kt}$ does not depend on $t$.  Therefore
  \[
  X(t)e^{-kt} = X(t_0) e^{-kt_0} = X_0 e^{-kt_0}, \text{ for any $t$.}
  \]
  Multiply with $e^{kt}$ and we end up with
  \[
  X(t) = X_0e^{k(t-t_0)}.
  \]
\end{proof}
The equations \eqref{eq:07constant-relative-growth} and
\eqref{eq:07exp-growth-diffeq} are examples of \textit{differential
  equations}.  They are equations in which the unknown quantity $X$ is
not a number but a function, and in which the derivative of the
unknown function appears.  We have just reasoned that any function
that satisfies \eqref{eq:07constant-relative-growth} (has constant
relative growth) must be of the form \eqref{eq:07exponentialgrowth}:
we have solved the differential equation\footnote{The trick we used here is an
example of solving differential equations by multiplying with an ``integrating
factor''.  We will do this more systematically in Math 222.}.




\subsection{Examples of constant relative growth or decay} %{{{2
\label{sec:07examples-of-const-relative-growth}
Here is a typical scenario of constant relative growth or, rather,
decay.  Suppose that the molecules of a certain chemical substance
appear in two varieties, the ``normal'' kind A, and the ``excited''
kind A$^*$.  Left to themselves the normal kind of molecules A are
stable, but the excited kind will randomly decay to the normal kind.
In the long run all A$^*$ will be converted into regular A molecules.
One example of this kind of reaction is radioactive decay where, say,
\raisebox{-3pt}{\footnotesize14}C decays to
\raisebox{-3pt}{\footnotesize14}N.  There are \textit{many} other
similar examples.




{\itshape%
  How fast does the conversion from {\upshape A}$^*$ to {\upshape A}
  happen?}  A very common reasoning to find the conversion rate goes
like this.  Suppose $X(t)$ is the total amount of A$^*$ and suppose
that during a short time interval of length $\Delta t$ a certain
number of conversions from A$^*$ to A take place.  If the time
interval is short, then the number of conversions will be small, and
the total amount $X(t)$ of A$^*$ molecules will not change much.
Therefore, during the next short time interval of length $\Delta t$
you would expect the same number of conversions to happen.  Adding
these together you conclude that if you wait twice as long ($2\Delta
t$) then the number of conversions doubles; more generally, you would
expect the number of conversions during a short time interval of
duration $\Delta t$ to be proportional to $\Delta t$.




If on the other hand you fix the length of the time interval, but
double the amount of A$^*$ molecules, you would expect twice as many
conversions to occur, so, the number of conversions from A$^*$ to A
during some short time interval $\Delta t$ should also be proportional
with the amount of A$^*$ present.
\marginpar{\sffamily\footnotesize%
  To say that a reaction takes place in which A$^*$ decays
  to A you could write:\\
\centerline{A$^* \stackrel{k}\longrightarrow$ A.}\\
The $k$ above the arrow is the ``reaction rate.''  }


Putting this together, we see that the change in the amount of A$^*$
during a time interval of length $\Delta t$ should be proportional
both with $X$ and with $\Delta t$, so
\[
\Delta X \approx - k\cdot X\cdot \Delta t,
\]
for some constant $k$.  The approximation should be better as you make
the time interval shorter, and therefore, dividing by $X\Delta t$ and
taking the limit $\Delta t\to0$, we see that the amount of $X$ should
satisfy
\[
\frac{1} {X} \frac{dX} {dt} = -k,
\]
which is \eqref{eq:07constant-relative-growth}, but with $k$ replaced
by $-k$.  The conclusion is: if you know that at time $t_0$ the
amount of A$^*$ is $X(t_0) = X_0$, then at any other time $t$,
\[
X(t) = X_0 e^{-k(t-t_0)}.
\]








\subsection{Half time and doubling time. } %{{{2
If $X(t) = X_0 e^{kt}$ then one has
\[
X(t+T) = X_0e^{kt+kT} = X_0e^{kt}e^{kT} = e^{kT}X(t).
\]
In words, after a time $T$ goes by, an exponentially growing (decaying) quantity
changes by a factor $e^{kT}$.  If $k>0$, so that the quantity is actually
growing, then one calls
\[
T = \frac{\ln 2}{k}
\]
the \emph{doubling time} for $X$ because $X(t)$ changes by a factor $e^{kT} =
e^{\ln2} = 2$ every $T$ time units:  $X(t)$ doubles every $T$ time units.




If $k<0$ then $X(t)$ is decaying and one calls
\[
T = \frac{\ln 2}{-k}
\]
the \emph{half life} because $X(t)$ is reduced by a factor $e^{kT} = e^{-\ln 2}
= \frac12$ every $T$ time units.




\subsection{Determining $X_0$ and $k$. } %{{{2
The general exponential growth/decay function \eqref {eq:07exponentialgrowth}
contains only two constants, $X_0$ and $k$, and if you know the values of $X(t)$
at two different times then you can compute these constants.

Suppose that you know
\[
X_1 = X(t_1) \text{ and } X_2=X(t_2).
\]
Then we have
\[
X_0e^{kt_1} = X_1 \text{ and } X_2 = X_0e^{kt_2}
\]
in which $t_1, t_2, X_1, X_2$ are given and $k$ and $X_0$ are unknown.  
One first finds $k$ from
\[
\frac{X_1}{X_2}= \frac{X_0e^{kt_1}}{X_0e^{kt_2}}
=e^{k(t_1-t_2)}
\implies \ln\frac{X_1}{X_2}= k(t_1-t_2)
\]
which implies
\[
k = \frac{\ln X_1 - \ln X_2}{t_1-t_2}.
\]
Once you have computed $k$ you can find $X_0$ from
\[
X_0 = \frac{X_1}{e^{kt_1}} = \frac{X_2}{e^{kt_2}}.
\]
(both expressions should give the same result.)

\problem $\DS y= e^x $ %{{{3




\problem $\DS y= e^{-x} $ %{{{3




\problem $\DS y= e^{x}+e^{-2x} $ %{{{3
\answer %{{{3
$dy/dx = e^x - 2e^{-2x}$. Local min at $x = \frac13 \ln 2$.




$d^2y/dx^2 = e^x+4e^{-2x}>0$ always, so the function is convex.

\problem $\DS y= e^{3x}-4e^x $ %{{{3

$dy/dx = 3e^{3x} - 4 e^x$. Local min at $x=\frac12\ln\frac43$.




$d^2y/dx^2 = 9e^{3x} - 4e^{x}$ changes sign when $e^{2x} = \frac49$,
i.e.~at $x=\frac12\ln\frac49 = \ln\frac23 = \ln2-\ln3$.  Inflection
point at $x=\ln2-\ln 3$.




$\lim_{x\to-\infty}f(x) = 0$ so negative $x$ axis is a horizontal

% This problem requires a(n easy) substitution to solve, which is probably too hard.



\subprob ({\it Newton's law of cooling})
Newton's law of cooling states that the rate of change of temperature $T$
of an object is proportional to the difference between its temperature
and the ambient temperature, $U$, that is,
\[
  \frac{dT}{dt}=k\left(U-T(t)\right).
\]




A body is discovered at $7$ am. Its temperature is then $25^{\circ}$ C. By the
time police arrives at the site, at $8$ pm, the body has cooled at $20^{\circ}$
C. Assuming the normal body temperature in humans is $37^{\circ}$ C, and that
the ambient temperature is $5^{\circ}$ C, determine the time of death.

reactor. The normal temperature of the fuel rods in a working reactor is
