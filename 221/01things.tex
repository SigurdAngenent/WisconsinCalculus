\chapter{Numbers and Functions}


The subject of this course is ``functions of one real variable'' so we
begin by talking about the real numbers, and then discuss functions.


\section{Numbers} 


\subsection{Different kinds of numbers} 
The simplest numbers are the \emph{positive integers}
\[
1, 2, 3, 4,\cdots
\]
the number \emph{zero}
\[
0,
\]
and the \emph{negative integers}
\[
\cdots,-4, -3, -2, -1.
\]
Together these form the integers or ``whole numbers.''



Next, there are the numbers you get by dividing one whole number by another
(nonzero) whole number.  These are the so called fractions or \emph{rational
  numbers}, such as
\[
\frac 12,\, \frac13,\, \frac23,\, \frac 14,\,\frac24,\,
\frac34,\, \frac43,\, \cdots
\]
or
\[
-\frac 12,\, -\frac13,\, -\frac23,\, -\frac 14,\,-\frac24,\,
-\frac34,\, -\frac43,\, \cdots
\]
By definition, any whole number is a rational number (in particular zero is a
rational number.)


You can add, subtract, multiply and divide any pair of rational numbers and the
result will again be a rational number (provided you don't try to divide by
zero).

  \end{tabular}%
}
There are other numbers besides the rational numbers: it was discovered by the
ancient Greeks that the square root of 2 is not a rational number.  In other
words, there does not exist a fraction $\frac{m}{n}$ such that
\[
\bigl(\frac mn\bigr)^2 = 2, \text{ i.e. }
m^2= 2n^2.
\]
Nevertheless, if you compute $x^2$ for some values of $x$ between $1$ and $2$,
and check if you get more or less than $2$, then it looks like there should be
some number $x$ between $1.4$ and $1.5$ whose square is exactly $2$.

\subsection{A reason to believe in $\sqrt2$} 
The Pythagorean theorem says that the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides
1 and 1 must be a line segment of length $\sqrt2$.
In middle or high school you learned something similar to the following geometric
construction of a line segment whose length is $\sqrt2$.  Take a square with
side of length 1, and construct a new square one of whose sides is the diagonal
of the first square.  The figure you get consists of 5 triangles of equal area
and by counting triangles you see that the larger square  has exactly twice the
area of the smaller square.
\marginpar{\footnotesize\sffamily%
  \input{../figures/221/01smallsquareroot2.tex}}
Therefore the diagonal of the smaller square, being
the side of the larger square, is $\sqrt2$ as long as the side of the smaller
square.

So, we will \textit{assume} that there is such a number whose square is exactly
2, and we call it the square root of 2, written as $\sqrt2$.  There are more
than a few questions\footnote{Here are some questions: if we assume into
existence a number a number $x$ between $1.4$ and $1.5$ for which $x^2=2$, how
many other such numbers must we also assume into existence?  How do we know
there is ``only one'' such square root of 2? And how can we be sure that these
new numbers will obey the same algebra rules (like $a+b = b+a$) as the rational
numbers?} raised by assuming the existence of numbers like the square root of 2,
but we will not deal with these questions here.  Instead, we will take a more
informal approach of thinking of real numbers as ``infinite decimal
expansions''.


\subsection{Decimals} 
One can represent certain fractions as finite decimal numbers, e.g.,
\[
\frac{279}{25}= \frac{1116}{100} = 11.16.
\]
Some rational numbers cannot be expressed with a finite decimal expansion.  For instance,
expanding $\frac13$ as a decimal number leads to an unending ``repeating decimal'':
\[
\frac13 = 0.333\,333\,333\,333\,333\,\cdots
\]
It is impossible to write the complete decimal expansion of $\frac13$
because it contains infinitely many digits.  But we can describe the
expansion: each digit is a 3.


Every fraction can be written as a decimal number which may or may
not be finite.  If the decimal expansion doesn't terminate, then it will
repeat (although this fact is not so easy to show).  For instance,
\[
\frac17 = 0.142857\,142857\,142857\,142857\,\dots
\]
Conversely, any infinite repeating decimal expansion represents a
rational number.


A \emph{real number} is specified by a possibly unending decimal
expansion.  For instance,
\[
\sqrt 2 = 1.414\,213\,562\,373\,095\,048\,801\,688\,724\,
209\,698\,078\,569\,671\,875\,376\,9\dots
\]
Of course you can never write \textit{all} the digits in the decimal expansion,
so you only write the first few digits and hide the others behind dots. To
give a precise description of a real number (such as $\sqrt2$) you have to
explain how you could \textit{in principle} compute as many digits in the
expansion as you would like\footnote{What exactly we mean by specifying how to compute digits in decimal expansions of real numbers is another issue that is beyond the scope of this course.}.


\subsection{Why are real numbers called real? } 
All the numbers we will use in this first semester of calculus are ``real
numbers''. At some point in history it became useful to assume that there
is such a thing as $\sqrt{-1}$, a number whose square is $-1$.  No
real number has this property (since the square of any real number is
nonnegative) so it was decided to call this newly-imagined number ``imaginary''
and to refer to the numbers we already had (rationals, $\sqrt2$-like
things) as ``real''.

%!!! Discuss: There are useful things one can do with infinite-number arithmetic, provided one declares things like infinity minus infinity to be undefined.  Students generally want to do these kinds of heuristic calculations anyway, so why not tell them how to do it properly? A revamped discussion would also significantly improve the treatment of infinite limits in the limits chapter.

\subsection{Reasons not to believe in $\infty$} 
\label{sec:infinity-not-a-number}
In calculus we will often want to talk about very large and very small
quantities.  We will use the symbol $\infty$ (pronounced ``infinity'')
all the time, and the way this symbol is traditionally used would suggest that we
are thinking of $\infty$ as just another number.  But $\infty$ is
different.  The ordinary rules of algebra don't apply to $\infty$.  As
an example of the many ways in which these rules can break down, just
think about ``$\infty + \infty$.''  What do you get if you add
infinity to infinity?  The elementary school argument for finding the
sum is: ``if you have a bag with infinitely many apples, and you add
infinitely many more apples, you still have a bag with infinitely many
apples.'' So, you would think that
\[
\infty + \infty = \infty.
\]
If $\infty$ were a number to which we could apply the rules of
algebra, then we could cancel $\infty$ from both sides,
\[
\infty + \not\!\!\infty = \not\!\!\infty \implies \infty = 0.
\]
So infinity is the same as zero!  If that doesn't bother you, then
let's go on.  Still assuming $\infty$ is a number we find that
\[
\frac{\infty}{\infty} = 1,
\]
but also, in view of our recent finding that $\infty = 0$,
\[
\frac{\infty}{\infty} = \frac{0}{\infty} = 0.
\]
Therefore, combining these last two equations,
\[
1=\frac { \infty }{\infty}=0.
\]
In elementary school terms: ``one apple is no apple.''


This kind of arithmetic is not going to be very useful for scientists (or
grocers), so we need to drop the assumption that led to this nonsense,
i.e.\ we have to agree from here on that \footnote{That is not the end of
  the story.  Twentieth century mathematicians have produced a theory of
  ``non standard real numbers'' which includes infinitely large numbers.
  To keep the theory from running into the kind of nonsense we just
  produced, they had to assume that there are many different kinds of
  infinity: in particular $2\times\infty$ is not the same as $\infty$, and
  $\infty\times\infty = \infty^2$ is yet another kind of infinity.  Since
  there are many kinds of infinity in this theory you can't use the single
  symbol ``$\infty$'' because it doesn't say \emph{which} infinitely large
  number you would be talking about.  In this course we will follow the
  traditional standard approach, and assume there are no ``infinitely large
  numbers.'' But if you want to read the version of the theory where
  infinitely large and small numbers do exist, then you should see

\subsection{The real number line and intervals} 
It is customary to visualize the real numbers as points on a straight
line.  We imagine a line, and choose one point on this line, which we
call the \emph{origin}.  We also decide which direction we call
``left'' and hence which we call ``right.''  Some draw the number line
vertically and use the words ``up'' and ``down.''

To plot any real number $x$ one marks off a distance $x$ from the
origin, to the right (up) if $x>0$, to the left (down) if $x<0$.

The \emph{distance along the number line} between two numbers $x$ and
$y$ is $|x-y|$.  In particular, the distance is never a negative
number.

\begin{figure}[h]\centering
  \input{../figures/221/01drawaninterval.tex}
  \caption{To draw the half open interval $[-1,2)$ use a filled dot to
    mark the endpoint that is included and an open dot for an excluded
    endpoint.  Some like to draw the number line vertically, like a
    thermometer.  }
  \label{fig:01drawaninterval}
\end{figure}
\marginpar{\input{../figures/221/01drawaninterval-vertical.tex}}%

In modern abstract mathematics a collection of real numbers (or any
other kind of mathematical objects) is called a \emph{set}.  Below are
some examples of sets of real numbers.  We will use the notation from
these examples throughout this course.

The collection of all real numbers between two given real numbers forms
an interval.  The following notation is used:
\begin{itemize}
\item $(a,b)$ is the set of all real numbers $x$ that satisfy $a<x<b$.
\item $[a, b)$ is the set of all real numbers $x$ that satisfy $a\leq x<b$.
\item $(a, b]$ is the set of all real numbers $x$ that satisfy $a< x\leq b$.
\item $[a, b]$ is the set of all real numbers $x$ that satisfy $a\leq x\leq b$.
\end{itemize}
If the endpoint is not included then it may be $\infty$ or $-\infty$.
E.g.\ $(-\infty, 2]$ is the interval of all real numbers (both
positive and negative) that are $\leq 2$.

\begin{figure}[t]\centering
  \input{../figures/221/01root2ontheline.tex}
  \caption{To find $\sqrt2$ on the real line you draw a square of side length
    $1$ and drop the diagonal onto the real line.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Set notation} 
\label{sec:set-notation}
A common way of describing a set is to say it is the collection of all
    real numbers that satisfy a certain condition.  We use curly braces $\{
    \cdot \}$ to denote sets:
\[
\setA = \bigl\{ x \mid \text{$x$ satisfies this or that condition}\bigr\}
\]
Most of the time we will use upper case letters in a calligraphic font
to denote sets.  ($\setA$,$\setB$,$\setC$,$\setD$, \dots)


For instance, the interval $(a, b)$ can be described as
\[
(a, b) = \bigl\{x \mid a<x<b\bigr\}
\]
The set
\[
\setB = \bigl\{x \mid x^2-1>0\bigr\}
\]
consists of all real numbers $x$ for which $x^2-1>0$, i.e.\ it consists of all
real numbers $x$ for which either $x>1$ or $x<-1$ holds.  This set consists of
two parts: the interval $(-\infty, -1)$ and the interval $(1, \infty)$.

You can try to draw a set of real numbers by drawing the number line and
coloring the points belonging to that set red, or by marking them in some other
way.


Some sets can be very difficult to draw.  For instance,
\[
\setC = \bigl\{x \mid \text{$x$ is a rational number}\bigr\}
\]
can't be accurately drawn.  In this course we will try to avoid such sets.


Sets can also contain a finite collection of numbers which we can simply list, like
\[
\setD = \{1, 2, 3\}
\]
so that $\setD$ is the set containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3.  Or the set
\[
\setE = \bigl\{x \mid x^3-4x^2+1 = 0\bigr\}
\]
which consists of the solutions of the equation $x^3-4x^2+1=0$.
(There are three of them, but it is not easy to give a formula for the
solutions.)


If $\setA$ and $\setB$ are two sets then \emph{the union of $\setA$ and $\setB$}
is the set that contains all numbers that belong either to $\setA$ or to
$\setB$.  The following notation is used
\[
\setA\cup\setB = \bigl\{x \mid
\text{$x$ belongs to $\setA$ or to $\setB$ or both.}\bigr\}
\]
Similarly, the \emph{intersection of two sets $\setA$ and $\setB$} is the set of
numbers that belong to both sets.  This notation is used:
\[
\setA\cap\setB = \bigl\{x \mid
\text{$x$ belongs to both $\setA$ and $\setB$.}\bigr\}
\]
\section{Problems} 
\problemfont 
\begin{multicols}{2}\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
\problem What is the $2007^{\textit{th}}$ digit after the period in the expansion 
of $\frac17$?
\answer 
The decimal expansion of
\[
1/7 = 0.\overline{142857}\,142857\,142857\,\cdots
\]
repeats after 6 digits.  Since $2007 =
334\times6+3$ the $2007^{\textrm{th}}$ digit is the same as the
$3^{\textrm{rd}}$, which happens to be a $2$.

\problem Suppose $\setA$ and $\setB$ are intervals.  Is it always true that 
$\setA\cap\setB$ is an interval?  How about $\setA\cup\setB$?




% !!! Issue: Is a single element {1} an interval?  How about the empty set?



\problem Consider the sets 
\[
\setM = \bigl\{x \mid x>0\bigr\} \text{ and }
\setN =  \bigl\{y \mid y>0\bigr\}.
\]
Are these sets the same?
\answer 
Yes these are the same sets.  Both sets consist of all positive real
numbers: since they contain exactly the same numbers, they are the
same sets.

\problem \groupproblem 
Write the numbers

  y=0.273273273273\dots\\
  \text{ and }
  z=0.21541541541541541\dots
\end{gather*}
as fractions (that is, write them as $\frac mn$, specifying $m$ and
$n$.)


% !!! Issue: This problem is nonsense without a notion of convergent sequence.

(Hint: show that $100x=x+31$. A similar trick works for $y$, but $z$
is a little harder.)
\answer 
$100x = 31.313131\cdots = 31+x \implies 99x = 31 \implies x =
\frac{31}{99}$.

Similarly, $1000y = 273 + y$ so $y= \frac{273}{999}$.

In $z$ the initial ``$2$'' is not part of the repeating pattern, so
subtract it:  $z = 0.2 + 0.0154154154\cdots$.  Now let
$w=0.0154154154\cdots$.  You get $1000w = 15.4+w = 15\frac25 + w =
\frac{77}{5}+w$. Therefore $w= \frac{77}{5\times 999}$.
From this you get
\[
z = \tfrac15+w = \tfrac15 +  \frac{77}{5\times999} = \frac{1076}{4995}.
\]
\endanswer

\problem \groupproblem\label{ex:no-infinitely-small-numbers} 
\subprob In \S\ref{sec:infinity-not-a-number} we agreed that
infinitely large numbers don't exist. Do infinitely small numbers
exist?   In other words, does there exist a \emph{positive} number $x$
that is smaller than $\frac1n$ for all $n=1, 2, 3, 4, \cdots$, i.e.
\begin{gather*}
  0<x<\tfrac{1}{2}, \text{ and }
  0<x<\tfrac{1}{3}, \text{ and } \\
  0<x<\tfrac{1}{4}, \text{ and so on} \cdots?

\subprob
Is the number whose decimal expansion after the period consists only
of nines, i.e.
\[
a=0.99999999999999999\dots
\]
the same as the number $1$?  Or could it be that there are numbers
between $0.9999\cdots$ and $1$?  That is, is it possible that there is
some number $x$ that satisfies
\[
0.999999\cdots < x < 1 \; ?
\]

\subprob  Here is a very similar question:  is
\[
b=0.3333333333333333333\dots
\]
the same as $\frac13$?  Or could there be a number $x$ with
\[
0.333333\dots <x<\tfrac13 ?
\]

\section{Functions} 

\subsection{Dependence} 
Calculus deals with quantities that change.  For
instance, the water temperature $T$ of Lake Mendota (as measured at
the pier near the Memorial Union) is a well-defined quantity, but it
changes with time.  At each different time $t$ we will find a
different temperature $T$.  Therefore, when we say ``the temperature at
the pier of Lake Mendota,'' we could mean two different things:   


\begin{itemize}
\item On one hand we could mean the ``temperature at some given
  time,'' e.g.~the temperature at 3pm is 68F: here the temperature is
  just a number.  The most common notation for this is $T(3) = 68$, or
  $T(3\textrm{pm}) = 68\textrm{F}$.

\item On the other hand we could mean the ``temperature in general,''
  i.e.~the temperatures at all times.  In that second interpretation
  the temperature is not just a number, but a whole collection of
  numbers, listing \emph{all} times $t$ and the corresponding
  temperatures $T(t)$.
\end{itemize}


So $T(t)$ is a number while $T$ by itself is not a number, but a more
complicated thing.  It is what in mathematics is called a
\emph{function}.  We say that \textit{the water temperature is a
  function of time.}

Here is the definition of what a mathematical function is:

\subsection{Definition} 
%% eric bach suggests including a comment about computability
%% perhaps a textbox in a figure that raises the question 
%% if the function 
%% f(x) = 1 if the decimal expansion has 200 consecutive zeroes
%%        0 otherwise
%% is well defined.  What is f(pi)?  We do not know all decimals 
%% of pi and we can only compute them one at a time.  If f(pi)=0
%% then the computation that shows this might take infinitely long,
%% i.e. we would never know.
\itshape
To specify a \emph{function} $f$ you must
\begin{enumerate}
\item give a \emph{rule} that tells you how to compute the value $f(x)$ of
  the function for a given real number $x$, and:
\item say for which real numbers $x$ the rule may be applied.
\end{enumerate}%
The set of numbers for which a function is defined is called its \emph{domain}.
The set of all possible numbers $f(x)$ as $x$ runs over the domain is called the
\emph{range} of the function.  The rule must be \emph{unambiguous:} the same
$x$ must always lead to the same $f(x)$.
\upshape

\medskip

For instance, one can define a function $f$ by putting $f(x) = 3x$ for all
$x\geq0$.  Here the rule defining $f$ is ``multiply by 3 whatever
number you're given'', and the function $f$ will accept all real numbers.


The rule that specifies a function can come in many different forms.  Most
often it is a formula, as in the square root example of the previous paragraph.
Sometimes you need a few formulas, as in
\[
g(x) =
\begin{cases}
  2x & \text{for } x<0 \\
  x^2 & \text{for }x\geq0
\end{cases}
\qquad
\text{domain of $g$} = \text{all real numbers.}
\]
Functions whose definition involves different formulas on different
intervals are sometimes called \emph{piecewise defined functions.}

\subsection{Graphing a function} 
  %%% !!! Issue: The Euclidean plane has not been defined!
You get the \emph{graph of a function} $f$ by drawing all points whose
coordinates are $(x,y)$ where $x$ is in the domain of $f$ and $y = f(x)$.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \input{../figures/221/01graphOFf.tex}
  \caption{The graph of a function $f$. The domain of $f$ consists
    of all $x$ values at which the function is defined, and the range consists
    of all possible values $f$ can have.}
  \label{fig:01graphOFf}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \input{../figures/221/01line.tex}
  \caption{The graph of $f(x) = mx+n$ is a straight line.
    It intersects the $y$-axis at height $n$.
    The ratio between the amounts by which $y$ and $x$ increase as you
    move from one point to another on the line is
    $\frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0} = m$.  This ratio is the same, no matter
    how you choose the points $P_0$ and $P_1$ as long as they are different and on
    the line.}\label{fig:01line}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Linear functions} 
A function $f$ that is given by the formula
\[
f(x) = mx + n
\]
where $m$ and $n$ are constants is called a \emph{linear function}.  Its graph
is a straight line.  The constants $m$ and $n$ are the \emph{slope} and
\emph{$y$-intercept} of the line, respectively.  Conversely, any straight line
which is not vertical (not parallel to the $y$-axis) is the graph of a linear
function.  If we know two points $(x_0, y_0)$ and $(x_1, y_1)$ on the line, then
we can compute the slope $m$ from the ``rise-over-run'' formula
\[
m = \frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}.
\]
This formula actually contains a theorem from Euclidean geometry,
namely, it says that the ratio
\[
(y_1-y_0):(x_1-x_0)
\]
is the same for every pair of distinct points $(x_0, y_0)$ and $(x_1, y_1)$
that you could pick on the line.


\subsection{Domain and ``biggest possible domain.'' } 
In this course we will usually not be careful about specifying the
domain of a function.  When this happens the domain is understood to
be the set of all $x$ for which the rule that tells you how to
compute $f(x)$ is a meaningful real number.  For instance, if we say that $h$ is the
function
\[
h(x) = \sqrt x
\]
then the domain of $h$ is understood to be the set of all nonnegative real
numbers
\[
\text{domain of $h$} = [0, \infty)
\]
since $\sqrt x$ is a well-defined real number for all $x\geq 0$ and not a real number for $x<0$.


A systematic way of finding the domain and range of a function for which you are
only given a formula is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The domain of $f$ consists of all $x$ for which $f(x)$ is well-defined
  (``makes sense'')
\item The range of $f$ consists of all $y$ for which you can solve the
  equation $f(x) = y$ to obtain at least one (real) value of $x$.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Example -- find the domain and range of $f(x) = 1/x^2$} 
The expression $1/x^2$ can be computed for all real numbers $x$ except
$x=0$ since this leads to division by zero.  Hence the domain of the
function $f(x) = 1/x^2$ is
\[
\text{``all real numbers except $0$''}
=\bigl\{x \mid x\neq0\bigr\} = (-\infty, 0)\cup(0, \infty).
\]
To find the range we ask ``for which $y$ can we solve the equation
$y=f(x)$ for $x$,'' i.e.\ for which $y$ can we solve $y=1/{x^2}$ for
$x$?


If $y=1/x^2$ then we must have $x^2 = 1/y$, so first of all, since we
have to divide by $y$, $y$ can't be zero.  Furthermore, $1/y=x^2$ says
that $y$ must be positive.  On the other hand, if $y>0$ then $y=1/x^2$
  has a solution (in fact two solutions), namely $x=\pm1/\sqrt{y}$.  This
shows that the range of $f$ is
\[
\text{``all positive real numbers''} = \{x \mid x>0\} = (0, \infty).
\]
\subsection{Functions in ``real life''} 
One can describe the motion of an object using a function.  If some
object is moving along a straight line, then you can define the
following function: Let $s(t)$ be the distance from the object to a
fixed marker on the line, at the time $t$.  Here the domain of the
function is the set of all times $t$ for which we know the position of
the object, and the rule is
\begin{center}
  \itshape Given $t$, measure the distance between the object at time $t$ and the
  marker.
\end{center}
\smallskip
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{01car.png}}%
There are many examples of this kind.  For instance, a biologist could
describe the growth of a mouse by defining $m(t)$ to be the mass of the mouse
at time $t$ (measured since the birth of the mouse).  Here the domain is the
interval $[0, T]$, where $T$ is the lifespan of the mouse, and the rule
that describes the function is
\begin{center}
  \itshape Given $t$, weigh the mouse at time $t$.
\end{center}


\marginpar{\includegraphics[width=48pt]{01hourglass.pdf}}%
  % !!! Pedantic issue: Sand falling an hourglass doesn't actually look like this.
Here is another example: suppose you are given an hourglass.  If you turn
it over, then sand will pour from the top part to the bottom part.  At any
time $t$ you could measure the height of the sand in the bottom and
call it $h(t)$.  Then, as in the previous examples, you can say that the height of
the sand is a function of time.  But in this example you can let the two
variables height and time switch roles: given a value for $h$ you wait
until the pile of sand in the bottom has reached height $h$ and check what
time it is when that happens: the resulting time $t(h)$ is determined by
the specified height $h$.  In this way you can regard time as a function of
height.




\subsection{The Vertical Line Property} 
Generally speaking, graphs of functions are curves in the plane but
they distinguish themselves from arbitrary curves by the way they
intersect vertical lines: \emph{The graph of a function cannot
intersect a vertical line ``$x=\text{\em constant}$'' in more than one
point}.  The reason why this is true is very simple: if two points lie
on a vertical line, then they have the same $x$ coordinate, so if they
also lie on the graph of a function $f$, then their $y$-coordinates
must both be equal to $f(x)$, so in fact they are the same point.



\subsection{Example -- a cubic function} 
The graph of $f(x) = x^3-x$ ``goes up and down,'' and, even though it
intersects several horizontal lines in more than one point, it
intersects every vertical line in exactly one point.  See
Figure~\ref{fig:01horizontal-and-vertical-line-tests}.
  % !!! Issue: The horizontal line test is not mentioned in the text!




\begin{figure}[t]\centering
  \input{../figures/221/01cubicANDcircle.tex}%
  \caption{The graph of $y=x^3-x$ fails the ``horizontal line test,'' but it
    passes the ``vertical line test.''  The circle fails both tests.}
  \label{fig:01horizontal-and-vertical-line-tests}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Example -- a circle is not a graph of a function $y=f(x)$} 
\label{sec:01circle-izno-graph}
The collection of points determined by the equation $x^2+y^2=1$ is a circle.  It
is not the graph of a function since the vertical line $x=0$ (the $y$-axis)
intersects the graph in two points $P_1(0,1)$ and $P_2(0,-1)$. See again
Figure~\ref{fig:01horizontal-and-vertical-line-tests}.  This example
continues in \S~\ref{sec:implicit-example-h1h2h3} below.


\section{Implicit functions} 
    % !!! Terminology: We should call these things implicit relations, not implicit
    % functions. This fixes a lot of annoying pedantic issues, particularly with
    % talking about the domain. The correct notion to introduce is not whether an
    % implicit relation globally defines a function, but whether it locally defines
    % one. (Even this, nobody really cares much about.)
    % This section needs a lot of wording fixes.
For many functions the rule that tells you how to compute it is not an explicit
formula, but instead an equation that you still must solve.  A function that is
defined in this way is called an ``implicit function.''  


\subsection{Example} 
We can define a function $f$ by saying that if $x$ is any given number,
then $y = f(x)$ is the solution of the equation
\[
x^2+2y-3=0.
\]
In this example we can solve the equation for $y$,
\[
  y = \frac{3-x^2}{2}.
\]
Thus we see that the function we have defined is $f(x) = (3-x^2)/2$.

Here we have two definitions of the same function, namely
\begin{itemize}
\item [(i)] ``$y=f(x)$ is defined by $x^2+2y-3=0$,'' and
\item [(ii)] ``$f$ is defined by $f(x) = (3-x^2)/2$.''
\end{itemize}
The first definition is an implicit definition, the second is explicit.
This example shows that with an ``implicit function'' it is not the
function itself, but rather the way it was defined that is implicit.

\subsection{Another example: domain of an implicitly defined function} 
Define $g$ by saying that for any $x$ the value $y=g(x)$ is the
solution of
\[
  x^2+xy-3=0.
\]
Just as in the previous example you can then solve for $y$, and you
find that
\[
  g(x) = y = \frac{3-x^2}x.
\]
Unlike the previous example this formula does not make sense when $x=0$, and
indeed, for $x=0$ our rule for $g$ says that $g(0) = y$ is the solution of
\[
  0^2+0\cdot y-3=0, \text{ i.e. $y$ is the solution of }3=0.
\]
That equation has no solution and hence $x=0$ does not belong to the domain
of our function $g$.  

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \input{../figures/221/01circle.tex}
  \caption{The circle determined by $x^2+y^2=1$ is not the graph of a
  function, but it contains the graphs of the two functions
  $h_1(x) = \sqrt{1-x^2}$ and $h_2(x)= -\sqrt{1-x^2}$.}
  \label{fig:01circle}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Example: the equation alone does not determine the function} 
% !!! this entire section is useless, pedantic hairsplitting
\label{sec:implicit-example-h1h2h3}
We saw in \S~\ref{sec:01circle-izno-graph} that the unit circle is not
the graph of a function (because it fails the vertical line test).
What happens if you ignore this fact and try to use the equation
$x^2+y^2=1$ for the circle to define a function anyway?
To find out, suppose we define $y=h(x)$ to be ``the solution'' of
\[
  x^2 + y^2=1.
\]
If $x>1$ or $x<-1$ then $x^2>1$ and there is no solution, so $h(x)$ is
at most defined when $-1\leq x\leq 1$.  But when $-1<x<1$ there is
another problem: not only does the equation have a solution, it
has \emph{two} solutions:
\[
  x^2+y^2=1 \iff y = \sqrt{1-x^2} \text{ or } y=-\sqrt{1-x^2}.
\]
The rule that defines a function must be unambiguous, and since we
have not specified which of these two solutions is $h(x)$ the function
is not defined for $-1<x<1$.



Strictly speaking, the domain of the function that is defined implicitly by
the equation $x^2+y^2=1$ consists of only two points, namely $x=\pm1$.
Why?  Well, those are the only two values of $x$ for which the equation has
exactly one solution $y$ (the solution is $y=0$.)  To see this in the
picture, look at Figure~\ref{fig:01circle} and find all vertical lines that
intersect the circle on the left exactly once.  


To get different functions that are described by the equation $x^2+y^2=1$,
we have to specify for each $x$ which of the two solutions
$\pm\sqrt{1-x^2}$ we declare to be ``$f(x)$''.  This leads to many possible
choices.  Here are three of them:
\begin{align*}
  h_1(x) & = \text{the non negative solution $y$ of } x^2+y^2=1 \\
  h_2(x) & = \text{the non positive solution $y$ of } x^2+y^2=1 \\
  h_3(x) & =
  \begin{cases}
    h_1(x) & \text{when $x<0$} \\
    h_2(x) & \text{when $x\geq0$} \\
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
There are many more possibilities.



\subsection{Why and when do we use implicit functions? Three examples} 
% None of these examples is useful or gives any motivation for why implicit relations are necessary.
\label{sec:why-implicit}
In all the examples we have done so far we could replace the implicit
description of the function with an explicit formula.  This is not always
possible, or, even if it is possible, then the implicit description can still be much
simpler than the explicit formula.



As a first example, define a function $f$ by saying that $y=f(x)$ if
and only if $y$ is the largest of the solutions of
\begin{equation}\label{eq:01quadratic-implicit}
  y^2+3y+2x = 0.
\end{equation}
This means that the recipe for computing $f(x)$ for any given $x$ is ``solve the
equation $y^2+3y+2x = 0$ for $y$ and, if the solutions are real numbers, then
set $y$ equal to the largest solution you find.''  For example, to compute
$f(0)$, we set $x=0$ and solve $y^2+3y=0$.  By factoring $y^2+3y = (y+3)y$, we
find that the solutions are $y=0$ and $y=-3$.  Since $f(0)$ is defined to be the
\textit{largest} of the solutions, we get $f(0)=0$.  Similarly, to compute
$f(1)$ we solve $y^2+3y +2\cdot1=0$: the solutions are $y=-1$ and $y=-2$, so
$f(1) = -1 $.  For any other $x\leq \frac{9}{8}$ the quadratic formula tells us
that the solutions are
\[
  y = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{3^2-4\cdot 2x}} {2} = \frac{-3\pm\sqrt{9-8x}} {2}.
\]
By definition $f(x)$ is the largest solution, so
\[
  f(x) = -\frac{3} {2} + \frac{1} {2}\sqrt{9-8x} \, .
\]
If you don't like square roots, then the equation
\eqref{eq:01quadratic-implicit} looks a lot simpler than this formula,
and you would prefer to work with \eqref{eq:01quadratic-implicit}.



For a more extreme example, suppose you were asked to work with a
function $g$ defined implicitly by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:01cubic-implicit}
  y=g(x) \text{ if and only if } y^3+3y+2x = 0.
\end{equation}
This equation is a cubic equation and it is much harder to solve than the
quadratic equation we had before.  It turns out that for any value of $x$, there
is exactly one real value of $y$ for which $y^3+3y+2x=0$, and the solution was
found in the early 1500s by Cardano and Tartaglia \footnote{The solution was
actually found by Tartaglia and, according to some, stolen by Cardano.  To see
the solution and its history you can check the internet, and, in particular, the
Wikipedia pages on Cardano and Tartaglia.}.  Here it is :
\[
  y = g(x) = \sqrt[3]{-x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}-\sqrt[3]{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}.
\]
Don't worry about how this formula came about; let's just trust
Cardano and Tartaglia.  The implicit description
\eqref{eq:01cubic-implicit} looks a lot simpler, and when we try to
differentiate this function later on, it will be much easier to use
``implicit differentiation'' than to use the Cardano-Tartaglia formula
directly.

Finally, you could have been given the function $h$ whose definition is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:01transcendental-implicit}
  y=h(x) \text{ if and only if } \sin(y)+3y+2x = 0.
\end{equation}
There is no formula involving only standard functions (exponents, trig
and inverse trig functions, logarithms, etc.~for the solution to this
equation.  Nonetheless it turns out that no matter how you choose $x$,
the equation $\sin(y)+3y+2x=0$ has exactly one solution $y$; in fact,
you will prove this in Problem~\ref{ex:implicit-from-ch1}.  So the
function $h$ is well defined, but for this function the implicit
description is the only one available.




\section{Inverse functions} 
If we have a function $f$, which takes input values and sends them to an output,
we might want to try to define a function $f^{-1}$ which ``undoes'' $f$, by the
following prescription:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rule-for-inverse}
  \parbox{0.7\textwidth}{\centering\itshape%
  For any given $x$ we say that $y = f^{-1}(x)$\\[1pt]
    if $y$ is the solution of $f(y)=x$.}
\end{equation}
Note that $x$ and $y$ have swapped their usual places in this last equation!

The prescription \eqref{eq:rule-for-inverse} defines the inverse function
$f^{-1}$, but it does not say what the domain of $f^{-1}$ is.  By definition,
\textit{the domain of $f^{-1}$ consists of all numbers $x$ for which the
  equation $f(y) = x$ has \emph{exactly one} solution.} ` So if for some $x$ the
equation $f(y)=x$ has no solution $y$, then that value of $x$ does not belong to
the domain of $f^{-1}$.

If, on the other hand, for some $x$ the equation $f(y)=x$ has \textit{more than
  one} solution $y$, then the prescription \eqref{eq:rule-for-inverse} for
computing $f^{-1}(x)$ is ambiguous: which of the solutions $y$ should be
$f^{-1}(x)$?  When this happens we throw away the whole idea of finding the
inverse of the function $f$, and we say that the inverse function $f^{-1}$ is
undefined (``the function $f$ has no inverse''.)


\begin{figure}[b]
    \centering \input{../figures/221/01inversefunctions.tex}
    \caption{The graph of a function and its inverse are mirror images of each
      other.  Can you draw the mirror?}
    \label{fig:function-with-inverse}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Example -- inverse of a linear function}
Consider the function $f$ with $f(x)=2x+3$.  Then the equation $f(y) = x$ works
out to be
\[
2y+3=x
\]
and this has the solution
\[
y=\frac{x-3}2.
\]
So $f^{-1}(x)$ is defined for all $x$, and it is given by $f^{-1}(x) = (x-3)/2$.

\subsection{Example -- inverse of $f(x) = x^2$}
It is often said that ``the inverse of $x^2$ is $\sqrt{x}$.{}'' This is not
quite true, as you'll see in this and the next example.


Let $f$ be the function $f(x) = x^2$ with domain all real numbers.  What is
$f^{-1}$?

The equation $f(y) = x$ is in this case $y^2=x$.  When $x>0$ the equation has
two solutions, namely $y=+\sqrt{x} $ and $y = -\sqrt{x}$.  According to our
definition, the function $f$ does not have an inverse.

\subsection{Example -- inverse of $x^2$, again}
\label{sec:inverse-of-square}%
Consider the function $g(x) = x^2$ with domain all \emph{positive} real numbers.
To see for which $x$ the inverse $g^{-1}(x)$ is defined we try to solve the
equation $g(y) =x$, i.e.\ we try to solve $y^2 = x$.  If $x<0$ then this
equation has no solutions since $y^2\geq0$ for all $f$.  But if $x\geq 0$ then
$y^2 = x$ does have a solution, namely $y = \sqrt{x}$.

So we see that $g^{-1}(x)$ is defined for all positive real numbers $x$, and
that it is given by $g^{-1}(x) = \sqrt x$.

This example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:function-with-inverse}.  See also
Problem~\ref{ex:inverse-of-square}.

  \caption{Definition of $\arcsin x$ and $\arctan x$.  The dotted circles are
    unit circles.  On the left a segment of length $x$ and its arc sine are
    drawn.  The length of the arc drawn on the unit circle is the subtended
    angle in radians, i.e.~$\arcsin x$.  So $\arcsin x$ is the length of ``the
    arc whose sine is $x$.''}
  \label{fig:01arcsine-arctan-definition}
\end{figure}

\section{Inverse trigonometric functions}
The two most important inverse trigonometric functions are the \emph{arcsine}
and the \emph{arctangent}.  The most direct definition of these functions is
given in Figure~\ref{fig:01arcsine-arctan-definition}.  In words, $\theta =
\arcsin x$ is the angle (in radians) whose sine is $x$.  If $-1\leq x\leq 1$
then there always is such an angle, and, in fact, there are many such angles.
To make the definition of $\arcsin x$ unambiguous we always choose $\theta$ to
be the angle that lies between $-\frac\pi2$ and $+\frac\pi2$.  To see where the
name ``arcsine'' comes from, look at
Figure~\ref{fig:01arcsine-arctan-definition} on the left.


An equivalent way of defining the arcsine and arctangent is to say that they are
the inverse functions of the sine and tangent functions on a restricted domain.
E.g.~if $y=f(x) = \sin x$, then the inverse of the function $f$ is by definition
(see \eqref{eq:rule-for-inverse}) the function $f^{-1}$ with the property that
\[
y =f^{-1}(x) \iff x = f(y) = \sin y.
\]
If we restrict $y$ to the interval $-\frac\pi2\leq y \leq \frac\pi2$ then this
is just the definition of $\arcsin x$, so
\[
y =\sin x \iff x=\arcsin y, \quad \text{provided } -\tfrac\pi2 \leq x\leq \tfrac
\pi2.
\]
Likewise,
\[
y =\tan x \iff x=\arctan y, \quad \text{provided } -\tfrac\pi2 \leq x\leq \tfrac
\pi2.
\]
Forgetting about the requirement that $-\frac\pi2 \leq x\leq \frac \pi2$ can
lead to unexpected mistakes (see Problem~\ref{ex:01sine-of-arcsine}).

    arctangent is a mirror image of the graph of the tangent.  }
  \label{fig:01sine-and-arcsine}
\end{figure}%


Because of the interpretation of $y=\arcsin x$ as the inverse of the sine
function, the notations
\[
\arcsin x = \sin^{-1} x,\qquad \arctan x = \tan^{-1} x
\]
are very commonly used.

In addition to the arcsine and arctangent, people have also defined the
arccosine, the arcsecant and the arccosecant.  However, because they can all be
expressed in terms of the arcsine and arctangent, we will not bother with them.

\textbf{True or false?}

\subprob For all real numbers $x$ one has
\[
  \sin\bigl(\arcsin x\bigr) = x.
\]
\answer 
False: Since $\arcsin x$ is only defined if $-1\leq x\leq 1$ and hence
not for \emph{all} $x$, it is not true that $\sin\bigl(\arcsin
x\bigr) = x$ for \emph{all} real numbers $x$.
However, it is true that $\sin(\arcsin x) = x$ for all $x$ in
the interval $[-1,1]$.
\endanswer
\subprob For all real numbers $x$ one has
\[
  \arcsin\bigl(\sin x\bigr) = x.
\]
\answer 
$\arcsin(\sin x)$ is defined for all $x$ since $\sin x$ is
defined for all $x$, and $\sin x$ is always between $-1$ and $1$.
However the arcsine function always returns a number (angle) between
$-\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$, so $\arcsin( \sin x) = x$ can't be true when
$x>\pi/2$ or $x<-\pi/2$.  For $|x|\leq \pi/2$ it is true that $\arcsin
\sin x = x$.
\endanswer
\subprob For all real numbers $x$ one has
\[
  \arctan\bigl( \tan x\bigr) = x.
\]
\answer 
Again, not true: if $x=\pi/2$ then $\tan x$ is not defined and therefore
$\arctan(\tan x)$ is not defined either.


Apart from that, $\arctan (\text{anything})$ always lies
between $-\pi/2 $ and $+\pi/2$, so $\arctan(\tan x)$ cannot
be the same as $x$ if either $x>\pi/2$ or $x<-\pi/2$.

Solve $2x+3 = t$ for $x$:  $x=\frac{t-3}{2}$.  Substitute this in $f(2x+3) =
x^2$ and you find $f(t) = \bigl(\frac{t-3}{2}\bigr)^2$.
\endanswer


\subprob $f(x)$
\answer 
From the previous problem we know what $f(t)$ is for any $t$ so just substitute $t=x$:
$f(x)= b\bigl(\frac{x-3}{2}\bigr)^2$.




\endanswer
\subprob $f(f(2))$
\answer 
$f(2) = \bigl((2-3)/2\bigr)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$.
\endanswer


\subprob $f(2f(x))$
\answer 
$f(2f(x)) = \bigl(\frac{2f(x)-3}{2}\bigr)^2 =
\Bigl\{\frac{2\bigl(\frac{x-3}{2}\bigr)^2 - 3}{2}\Bigr\}^2$.

\problem A function $f$ is given that satisfies 
\[
  f\bigl(\frac1{x+1}\bigr) = 2x-12
\]
for all real numbers $x$.

If $x$ and $t$ are arbitrary real numbers, then
compute the following quantities:

\subprob $f(1)$
\answer 
We know $f\bigl(\frac1{x+1}\bigr) = 2x-12$ for all $x$, so if we want to know
$f(1)$ then we have to find an $x$ with $\frac{1}{x+1} = 1$.  Solving $\frac{1}{x+1} = 1$
for $x$ you find $x=0$. Substitute $x=0$ in $f\bigl(\frac1{x+1}\bigr) = 2x-12$
and you get $f(1) = 2\times0-12 = -12$.
\endanswer


\subprob $f(0)$
\answer 
To find $f(0)$ you proceed as above, this time solving $\frac{1}{x+1} = 0$ for
$x$.  In this case there is no solution $x$, and therefore the equation
$f\bigl(\frac1{x+1}\bigr) = 2x-12$ does not tell us what $f(0)$ is.  Conclusion:
either 0 is not in the domain of $f$, or we cannot tell what $f(0)$ is from
the  information provided in the problem.
\endanswer



\subprob $f(t)$
\answer 
To find $f(t)$ you do the same as when you want to find $f(1)$.
We know $f\bigl(\frac1{x+1}\bigr) = 2x-12$ for all $x$, so if we want to know
$f(t)$ then we have to find an $x$ with $\frac{1}{x+1} = t$.  Solving $\frac{1}{x+1} = t$
for $x$ you find $x=\frac 1t -1$. Substitute $x=\frac 1t -1$ in $f\bigl(\frac1{x+1}\bigr) = 2x-12$
and you get $f(t) = 2\times\bigl(\frac{1}{t}-1\bigr)-12 = \frac{2}{t} -14 $.
\endanswer


\subprob $f(x)$
\answer 
$f(2f(x)) = \frac{2}{2f(x)} - 14 = \frac{1}{f(x)} - 14 =
\frac{1}{\frac{2}{x}-14} - 14$.  You could simplify this if you wanted to, but
that was not part of the question.
\endanswer



\subprob $f(f(2))$
\answer 
After finding $f(t) = \frac{2}{t} -14 $ you can substitute $t=x$ and you find
$f(x) = \frac{2}{x} -14 $.
\endanswer



\subprob $f(2f(x))$
\answer 
$f(2) = \frac{2}{2}-14 = -13 $ and therefore $f(f(2)) = f(-13) = \frac{2}{-13}-14 = -14\frac2{13} $.
\endanswer




\problem Does there exist a function $f$ that satisfies 
\[
  f(x^2) = x+1
\]
for \emph{all} real numbers $x$?
\answer 
No.  For instance if you set $x=1$ you get $f(1) = 1+1=2$, and if you set
$x=-1$ then you get $f((-1)^2) = (-1)+1$, i.e.\ $f(1) = 0$.  But $f(1)$
can't be equal to both $2$ and $0$, the formula $f(x^2) = x+1$ cannot be
true for all real numbers $x$.

The following exercises review precalculus material involving quadratic
expressions $ax^2+bx+c$ in one way or another.\upshape



\problem Find the vertex $(h,k)$ of the parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$.  Use the result 
to find the range of this function.  Note that the behavior depends on whether
$a$ is positive or negative.  (Hint: ``Complete the square'' in the quadratic
expression by writing it in the form $y=a(x-h)^2 + k$ for some $h$ and $k$ in
terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$.)



\problem Find the ranges of the following functions: 
\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= 2x^2+3 \\
  g(x) &= -2x^2+4x \\
  h(x) &= 4x +x^2\\
  k(x) &= 4\sin x + \sin^2 x \\
  \ell(x) &= 1/(1+x^2)\\
  m(x) &= 1/(3+2x+x^2).
\end{align*}
\answer 
$g(x) = -2\bigl(x^2-2x\bigr)
= -2\bigl(x^2-2x+1 -1\bigr)
= -2\bigl[(x-1)^2 -1\bigr]
=-2(x-1)^2 + 2$, so the range of $g$ is $(-\infty, 2]$.

Alternatively:


$y = g(x) \iff y = -2x^2+4x \iff 2x^2-4x+y = 0$.
The quadratic formula says that the solutions are
\[
  x= \frac{4\pm\sqrt{16-8y}} {4}.
\]
If $16-8y<0$ then there are no solutions and $y$ does
not belong to the range of $g$.

If $16-8y\geq0$ then there is at least one solution
and  $y$ does belong to the range of $g$.


Conclusion, the range of $g$ consists of all $y$ with
$16-8y\geq 0$, i.e.~ all $y\leq2$.

intersect the graph of $g(x) = 1/x$ in exactly one point and also
contain the point $(-1,1)$?
