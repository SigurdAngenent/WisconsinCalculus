Remember that to solve a differential equation of the form
\begin{equation}
    y''(x) + a y'(x) + b y(x) = 0
    \label{eq:cont-coeff-diffeq}
\end{equation}
you first try to find solutions of the form $y=e^{rx}$.  If you
substitute
$y=e^{rx}$ then you get
\begin{equation}\label{eq:characteristic-polynomial-appears}
    \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + a\frac{dy}{dx}+by = (r^2+ar+b) e^{rx}.
\end{equation}
The polynomial $P(r) = r^2+ar+b$ is called the \textit{characteristic
polynomial} of the equation.  The solutions of $P(r) = 0$ were called
the
characteristic roots.  When the two characteristic roots are different
you get two solutions, $e^{r_1x}$ and $e^{r_2x}$, but if $r_1=r_2$
then you only
get one solution namely, $y=e^{r_1x}$.  In math 222 we said that 
in this case $xe^{rx}$ is also a solution.  We can now give a short
explanation

$\bullet$ Treating $y= e^{rx}$ as a function of two variables $r$ and $x$, differentiate
both sides of equation \eqref{eq:characteristic-polynomial-appears} with respect
to $r$.  Call $\frac{\pd y}{\pd r} = z$.  What differential equation does
$z$ satisfy?

$\bullet$ The function $y(r, t) = \cos rt$ satisfies
\[
\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + 4 y = (4-r^2)\cos rt.
\]
By differentiating this equation with respect to $r$ 
you can find a particular solution for the equation 
\[
\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + 4 y = \sin2t
\]
Do this.
