\noindent This is a self contained set of lecture notes for Math 234. The
notes were written by Sigurd Angenent, some problems were
taken from Guichard's open calculus text which is available at
\url{http://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/multivariable/src/}

The \LaTeX\ files, as well as the \textsc{Python} and \textsc{Inkscape-svg}
files that were used to produce the notes before you can be obtained from
the following web site:
