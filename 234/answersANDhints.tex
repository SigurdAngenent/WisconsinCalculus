Every vector is a position vector.  To see of which point it is the position
vector translate it so its initial point is the origin.

Here $\tpv AB = \vek -3\\ 3 \tor$, so $\tpv AB$ is the position vector of
the point $(-3,3)$.

One always labels the vertices of a parallelogram counterclockwise (see
\S\ref{sec:diag-parall}).

$ABCD$ is a parallelogram if $\tpv AB + \tpv AD = \tpv AC$.
$\tpv AB = \vek 1\\ 1 \tor$, $\tpv AC = \vek 2\\ 3 \tor$, $\tpv AD = \vek 3\\
1 \tor$.  So $\tpv AB + \tpv AD \ne \tpv AC$, and $ABCD$ is not a
parallelogram.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I12.6a)}]

As in the previous problem, we want $\tpv AB + \tpv AD = \tpv AC$.
If $D$ is the point $(d_1, d_2, d_3)$ then
$\tpv AB = \vek 0\\ 1\\1 \tor$,
$\tpv AD = \vek d_1\\ d_2-2 \\ d_3-1\tor$,
$\tpv AC = \vek 4\\ -1\\ 3 \tor$,
so that $\tpv AB + \tpv AD = \tpv AC$ will hold if
$d_1 = 4$, $d_2 = 0$ and $d_3 = 3$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I12.6b)}]

Now we want $\tpv AB + \tpv AC = \tpv AD$, so $d_1 = 4$, $d_2 = 2$,
$d_3 = 5$.

\item[{\bfseries(I12.9)}]

Compute the dot product: $\va\dpp\vb = 2s+3(1-s) = 3-s$.  When the
dot-product vanishes the vectors are perpendicular; this happens when
$s=3$.  The angle between the vectors is acute is the dot-product is
positive.  This happens when $3-s>0$, i.e.~when $s<3$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I12.11a)}]

The problem is open-ended because it doesn't specify what ``draw'' means.

If you are allowed to use a calculator and a protractor, then you could use the
dot product to compute the angle $\theta$ between the two vectors; then, using
your protractor, draw two line segments that make this angle, and mark off
lengths 3 and 5 to get the vectors.  From the dot-product and the two lengths
you find $3\times5\times\cos\theta = -12$, so $\cos\theta = - \frac{12}{15}=
-0.8$, which implies $\theta = \arccos (-0.8) \approx 2.498\dots$ radians, or
$\theta\approx 143.13\dots$ degrees.

A different approach goes like this.  Suppose $\va$ is parallel to the $x_1$ axis; since $\va$ has length $3$, we can choose $\va=3\ves1$.  Now we look for a matching vector $\vb=\tvek b_1\\b_2\ttor$.  The condition that $\vb$ must have length 5
then says $b_1^2 + b_2^2 = 5^2 = 25$, while the dot-product is $\va\dpp\vb =
a_1b_1+a_2b_2 = 3b_1$.  Since the dot-product must be $-12$ we find
$b_1=-\frac{12}{3}=-4$.  Using the length of $\vb$ leads to
$b_2=\sqrt{25-(-4)^2} = \pm3$.  Thus we find two solutions: $\vb = \tvek -4\\
\pm3\ttor = -4\ves1\pm3\ves2$.

You make the drawing.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I12.11b)}]

No.  The inner product of two vectors is $\va\dpp\vb = \|\va\|\,\|\vb\|
\cos\theta$, and therefore it can never be larger than $\|\va\|\,\|\vb\|$.

$X$ has coordinates $(x, \sqrt{1-x^2})$;
${\tpv AX} = \vek 1+x \\ \sqrt{1-x^2} \tor $;
${\tpv BX} = \vek x-1 \\ \sqrt{1-x^2}\tor$.

$\tpv AX \dpp \tpv BX = (1+x)  (x-1) + \bigl(\sqrt{1-x^2}\bigr)^2 =x^2-1 + 1-x^2 = 0$.

So $\tpv AX$ and $\tpv BX$ are perpendicular.

\item[{\bfseries(I12.14b)}]

True:  This is Pythagoras' theorem.  Here is an algebraic derivation:
\begin{align*}
  \|\va+\vb\|^2 &= (\va+\vb) \dpp (\va+\vb)\\
  &= (\va+\vb) \dpp \va  + (\va+\vb) \dpp\vb\\
  &= \va \dpp \va +\vb \dpp \va  + \va \dpp\vb + \vb \dpp\vb\\
  &= \|\va\|^2 + 2 \va \dpp\vb + \| \vb \|^2\\
  &= \|\va\|^2 + \| \vb \|^2.
\end{align*}
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I12.14c)}]

Not so.
The same computation as for the previous problem shows
\begin{align*}
  \|\va - \vb\|^2 &= (\va-\vb) \dpp (\va-\vb)\\
  &= (\va-\vb) \dpp \va  - (\va-\vb) \dpp\vb\\
  &= \va \dpp \va -\vb \dpp \va  - \va \dpp\vb + \vb \dpp\vb\\
  &= \|\va\|^2 - 2 \va \dpp\vb + \| \vb \|^2\\
  &= \|\va\|^2 + \| \vb \|^2.
\end{align*}
Therefore
\[
\|\va-\vb\|^2 = \|\va\|^2 - \|\vb\|^2
\]
only is true if $\vb=\vvv0$.

\item[{\bfseries(I12.17a)}]

$\va\dpp\vc=\va\dpp(\va\cp\vb) =0$, but for the two given vectors in the problem
$\va\dpp\vc = -1\neq0$, so there cannot be a vector $\vb$ with $\va\cp\vb=\vc$
as $\vc$ is not perpendicular to $\va$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I12.17b)}]

In this case $\va\perp\vc$, so the argument from the first part of this problem
doesn't rule out that there might be a solution.  So let's try $\vb =
\tvek b_1\\b_2\\b_3\ttor$.  Then
\[
  \va\cp\vb
  = \vek b_2 \\ -b_1-2b_3 \\ 2b_2\tor \stackrel?= \vc
  = \vek 1\\3\\2\tor.
\]
Solving this for $b_1$, $b_2$, and $b_3$ leads to $b_2=1$, and $-b_1-2b_3=3$ as
only remaining equation.  Since we have found $b_2$ there are still two unknowns
left.  We can choose an arbitrary $b_3$ and set $b_1 = -3-2b_3$, e.g.~$b_3=0$
works, provided we choose $b_1 = -3$.

\item[{\bfseries(I12.19a)}]

First find the equation for the plane through $B, C, D$:  a normal vector for the plane is
\[
  \vn = \tpv BC \times \tpv BD = \vek 2\\0\\-3\tor \times \vek 0\\ 2 \\ -3\tor =
  \vek 6 \\  6 \\ 4 \tor.
\]
We also need a point on the plane, we choose $B$ (could also have chosen $C$ or $D$). The equation for the plane then is $\vn\cdot\vx = \vn\cdot\vb$, i.e.
\[
  6x_1+6x_2+4x_3 = -6-6+8 = -4.
\]
The distance from the point $A$ to the plane is given by
\[
  \pm d = \frac{\vn \cdot(\va-\vb)}{\|\vn\|}
  =\frac1{\sqrt{6^2+6^2+4^2}} \vek 6\\6\\ 4 \tor \cdot \vek 1-(-1) \\1-(-1)\\2-2 \tor
  = \frac{10}{\sqrt{6^2+6^2+4^2}}
  = \frac {10}{\sqrt{88}}.
\]
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I12.19b)}]

The angle between two planes is the angle between their normals.  A normal to $BCD$ is the vector $\vn$ from part (a) of this problem.  A normal to the $xy$-plane is $\vk = \tvek0\\0\\1\ttor$.

The cosine of the angle between the two planes is
\[
  \cos \angle(BCD, xy\text{-plane})
  = \cos \angle(\vn, \vk)
  = \frac {\vn \cdot \vk}{\|\vn\|\, \|\vk\|}
  = \frac {4}{\sqrt{88} \cdot 1}
  = \frac {4}{\sqrt{88}}.
\]
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I12.19c)}]

  The sign of $\vn\cdot(\vx-\vb)$ tells us if the point with position vector $\vx$ lies on the side of the plane $BCD$ that $\vn$ points to.  So to see if $A$ and $E$ are on the same side, we compare the signs of $\vn\cdot(\va-\vb)$ and $\vn\cdot(\ve-\vb)$.

  We have already computed $\vn\cdot(\va-\vb) = +10$; for the new point $E$ we have
  \[
    \vn\cdot(\ve-\vb) = \vek 6\\6\\4\tor \cdot \vek (-1)-(-1) \\(-1)-(-1)\\(-1)-2 \tor
    =4\cdot(-3) = -12.
  \]
   So $\vn\cdot(\va-\vb) = +10$ and $\vn\cdot(\ve-\vb) = -12$ have opposite signs, which means that $A$ and $E$ lie on opposite sides of the plane $BCD$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I12.19d)}]

  The direction of the line is given by the vector $\tpv AC = \vc-\va = \tvek 0 \\ -2 \\ -3\ttor$.

  A parametrization of the line is then given by
  \[
    \vx = \va + t\tpv AC =
    \vek 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \tor + t \vek 0 \\ -2 \\ -2 \tor
    = \vek 1 \\ 1-2t \\ 1-2t \tor.
  \]

  We see that $\vx$ lies on the $xy$ plane when its third component vanishes, i.e.~when $1-2t=0$.  This happens for $t=\frac12$.  The point where the line intersects the $xy$-plane is therefore $(1, 0, 0)$.

  To see where the line intersects the $xz$-plane, we check when the second component of $\vx$ vanishes.  The second component is the same as the third, namely $1-2t$, so we again get $t=\frac12$, and the intersection point is $(1, 0, 0)$.

  Finally, the first component of $\vx$ is $1$ for all values of $t$, so it never vanishes.  This line does not intersect the $yz$-plane.

\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(I12.20)}]

We have three points on the plane $A$, $B$, and the origin $O (0,0,0)$
From these we compute a normal
\[
\vn = \tpv OA \times \tpv OB
= \vek 2\\2\\1\tor \times \vek 2\\0\\3\tor
= \vek -1 \\ -4 \\ -4 \tor.
\]
The equation for the plane is then $\vn\cdot\vx = \vn\cdot\vp$, where $\vp$ is the position vector of any point we know to be on the plane:  we can choose $\vp$ to be either $\tpv OA$, $\tpv OB$, or $\vvv0$ (the position vector of the origin).  We choose $\vp=\vvv0$ because that is the easiest, but the other choices should give the same answer.  Thus we find the equation for the plane to be
\[
-x_1 -4x_2-4x_3=0.
\]
If you don't like all the minus signs, then you can multiply both sides with $-1$, which gives you $x_1+4x_2+4x_2=0$.

(a) the parabola, $y=x^2$

(b) The equation that we know for a parametrization of a line, $\vx=\va+t\vv$, contains the variables $\vx$ and $t$. We can't use those variables because they were already used in the problem. So we change them to, say, $\vy$ and $s$: we get
\[
  \vy = \va + s\overrightarrow{AX}
  =\vek 1\\ 0 \tor + s \vek t-1 \\ t^2 \tor =\vek 1+s(t-1) \\ st^2\tor.

(c) What is given, and what is unknown? Here $t$ is given. Varying $s$ will slide the point $Y$ with position vector $\vy$ along the line $\ell$. So we have to find an $s$ for which $Y$ is on the $y$-axis, and, since $t$ is given, our answer will depend on $t$. The point $Y$ is on the $y$-axis if its $x$-coordinate vanishes. So, we solve
\[
  1+s(t-1)=0 \implies s = \frac{1}{1-t}.
\]
Hence the intersection point is $Y$ with the above value of $s$
\[ \vy = \vek 0\\ t^2/(1-t) \tor. \]

Chapter 2, section 3, tells you how to find the parametrization of a line.  Read that first before reading the rest of this answer.  To parametrize a line, you need one point on the line, and a vector in the direction of the line.

(a) The velocity vector is $\vx'(t) = \vek 2t \\ 3t^2 \tor$, so the velocity vector at $t=1$ is $\vx'(1) = \vek2\\3 \tor$.
This vector is a tangent vector to the curve at the point $\vx(1) = \vek 1 \\1 \tor$. So the tangent
at this point is the line through $\vx(1)$ with direction $\vx'(1)$:
\[ \vy(t) = \vek 1\\1\tor + t \vek 2\\3\tor\]
The $t$ in this parametrization is not the same as the $t$ in the parametrization $\vx(t)$ for the curve.
To avoid confusion, one sometimes chooses a different letter, for instance,
\[ \vy(s) = \vek 1\\1\tor + s \vek 2\\3\tor \]
or, use a greek letter,
\[ \vy(\alpha) = \vek 1\\1\tor + \alpha \vek 2\\3\tor. \]

(b) The velocity vector is still $\vx'(t) = \vek 2t \\ 3t^2 \tor$, so the velocity vector at $t=a$ is $\vx'(a) = \vek 2a\\3a^2 \tor$.
This vector is a tangent vector to the curve at the point $\vx(a) = \vek a^2 \\a^3 \tor$.
So the tangent at this point is the line through $\vx(a)$ with direction $\vx'(a)$:
\[ \vy(t) = \vek a^2\\a^3\tor + t \vek 2a\\3a^2\tor \]
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(II17.7b)}]


At any point the velocity vector is $\vx' (t)=\vek 1\\2t\\3t^2\tor$.
In particular when $t=1$ we get
\[
  \vx(t)=\vek 1\\1\\1\tor, \qquad     \vx'(t)=\vek1\\ 2\\ 3\tor.
\]
Therefore the tangent at this point is given by
\[
  \vx(t) \vek 1\\1\\1\tor + t \vek1\\ 2\\ 3\tor.
\]
This notation is however problematic, because it uses $\vx$ and $t$, which already have a meaning: $\vx$ is the vector function describing the curve, and $t$ tells us which point $X(t)$ we have in mind.  So we must choose different letters that have not been used yet, like $\vy$ and $s$.   A correct answer is then
\[
  \vy(s) = \vek 1\\1\\1\tor + s \vek1\\ 2\\ 3\tor.
\]
That solves part (a).

Part (b) has a similar solution, except now the value of $t$ is not restricted to be $t=1$.
The parametric form of the tangent to the curve at the point $X(t)$ is given by
\[
  \vy(s) = \vek t\\t^2\\t^3\tor + s \vek 1\\ 2t\\ 3t^2\tor.
\]
The result depends on two parameters, $s$ and $t$.
The parameter $t$ selects a point $X(t)$ on the curve;  given $t$, the parameter $s$ selects a point on the tangent to the curve at the point $X(t)$.

Intersections with the $xy$-plane are found by setting the third coordinate of $\vy$ equal to zero.  You get $s=-t/3$, and thus
\[
  \vy=\vek \tfrac23 t \\ \tfrac13 t^2 \\ 0 \tor
\]

 $\kappa(x) = \dfrac{e^x}

To find the point with largest curvature:
$\kappa'(t) = \dfrac{e^t} {\bigl(1+e^{2t}\bigr)^{5/2}}
\bigl(1-2e^{2t}\bigr)$, so the maximal curvature (smallest radius of
curvature) occurs when $x=-\frac{1} {2}\ln{2}$.

To show that $\vm\dpp\vx(t)$ is constant we differentiate it with respect to time:
\[
\frac{d \vm\dpp\vx(t)} {dt} = \vm\dpp\vx'(t) = \vm\dpp\bigl(\vm\cp\vx(t)\bigr) = 0,
\]
because the cross product $\vm\cp\vx(t)$ is always perpendicular to the vector $\vm$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(II17.13)}]

The product rule for dot-products implies that
\[
  \frac{d \|\vv(t)\|^2}{dt}
  = \frac{d \vv(t)\dpp \vv(t)}{dt}
  =2\vv(t) \dpp \va(t)
\]
and also
\[
  \frac{d \|\vx(t)\|^2}{dt}
  = \frac{d \vx(t)\dpp \vx(t)}{dt}
  =2\vv(t) \dpp \vx(t).
\]
Therefore
\[
  f'(t) = 2\vv(t) \dpp \va(t) + K 2\vv(t) \dpp \vx(t).
\]
Factor out the common factor $2\vv(t)$ in both terms here to get
\[
  f'(t) = 2\vv(t) \dpp \bigl(\va(t) + K\vx(t)\bigr).
\]
Since we are given that $\va(t) = -K\vx(t)$, this last expression is zero.  Thus we have $f'(t) = 0$ for all $t$, which implies that $f(t)$ does not depend on time.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(II17.14)}]

  By the product rule for cross products of vector functions we have
  \[
    \frac{d \vx(t) \times \vx'(t)}{dt}
    =\frac{d\vx}{dt} \times \vx'(t) + \vx(t)\times \frac{d\vx'}{dt}
    =\vx'(t) \times \vx'(t) + \vx(t) \times \vx''(t).
  \]
  The first term vanishes because the cross product of any vector with itself vanishes.  The second term also vanishes because $\vx(t)$ and $\vx''(t)$ are given to be parallel, and the cross product of two vectors that are parallel always vanishes.

  Therefore the derivative of $\vx\times \vx'$ vanishes at every moment in time.  This implies that $\vx\times\vx'$ does not depend on time, i.e.~it is constant.

We need a point on the line (we choose $A$, although $B$ would be just as good).

\[

The velocity and acceleration are vectors.  They are the first and second derivatives of the position vector, so

  \va(t) = \vx''(t) = \vek 2 \sin t/\cos^3 t \\ 0\tor.
\]
The speed is the length of the velocity vector, i.e.
\[
  v(t) = \|\vv(t)\| = \sqrt{ \frac 1{\cos^4 t} + 1}.

    = 2\frac{\sin t}{\cos^5 t}.

  A parametrization of the tangent at the point $X(t)$ is given by
  \[
    \vy = \vx(t) + s \vv(t).
  \]
  Here $t$ determines at which point on the curve we are finding the tangent, and $s$ is the parameter along the tangent line.  So we get
  \[
    \vy = \vek \tan t \\ t \tor + s \vek 1/\cos^2 t \\ 1 \tor
    = \vek  \tan t + s/\cos^2 t \\ t + s \tor.
  \]
  $\vy$ will be the position vector of a point on the $x$-axis if the second component of $\vy$ vanishes, i.e.~if $s=-t$.  Therefore the intersection point with the $x$-axis has position vector
  \[
    \vy = \vek \tan t - t / \cos^2t \\ 0 \tor.

This quadratic form has no $x^2$ term.  When that happens you cna immediately factor
the form, because all terms contain $y$:
\[
Q(x,y) = xy+y^2 = (x+y)y.
\]
This form is indefinite.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(III5.5g)}]

Now this form does have an $x^2$ term, so we \textit{can} complete the square if we
want to \dots but if we look carefully then we see that there's not $y^2$ term.
Because of this we can factor out $x$, and we get
\[
  Q = x^2+2xy = x(x+2y).
\]
The form is indefinite.

What if we don't notice that $y^2$ is missing and just blindly complete the square?
Nothing goes wrong and we get the same answer:
\[
  Q = x^2+2xy = x^2+ 2xy +y^2 - y^2 = (x+y)^2 - y^2 = (x+y - y)(x+y+y) = x(x+2y).
\]
We did work too hard though \verb|:-(|

\item[{\bfseries(III5.6)}]

Complete the square:
\[
  Q=(x+ky)^2 - k^2 y^2 + y^2
   =(x+ky)^2 + (1- k^2) y^2.
\]
If $1-k^2>0$ then we have the sum of two squares.  If $1-k^2<0$, then we can rewrite
$Q$ as the difference of two squares
\[
   Q=(x+ky)^2 - (k^2-1) y^2
   =(x+ky)^2 - \bigl(\sqrt{k^2-1}y\bigr)^2
\]
which is indefinite.  That is all we need to know: we are not actually asked to
factor the form when it is indefinite.  But in case you're wondering, the somewhat
ugly formula is thus:
\[
  Q = \Bigl(x+(k+\sqrt{k^2-1}) y\Bigr) \Bigl(x+(k-\sqrt{k^2-1}) y\Bigr).
\]

The conclusion is that $Q(x,y)$ is positive definite if $-1<k<1$ and indefinite when
$k>1$ or $k<-1$.  In the remaining cases $k=\pm1$ we have
\[
  Q=(x+ky)^2 - k^2 y^2 + y^2
   =(x+ky)^2 + (1- k^2) y^2 = (x\pm y)^2,
\]
i.e.~ the form is a square (it is semidefinite).

for this problem the linear approximation of $f(x,y) = xy^2$ at
$(3,1)$ is
\[
f(x, y) \approx 3 + (x-3) + 6 (y-1) = x+6y-6.
\]
This approximation is only expected to be good when $(x,y)$ is close
to $(3,1)$.  The approximation contains an error which is small
compared to $|x-3|$ and $|y-1|$.

\textbf{FAQ:} What is the relation between the linear approximation

plane is the graph of the linear approximation. The linear

\[
\pdd fx = \frac{-2x}{\sqrt{2x^2+3y^2-4}},\qquad

The function is $f(x, y) = x \ln(xy)$.
We have $f(2, \frac{1}{2}) = 2\ln(2\cdot \frac12) = \ln 1 = 0$.
The gradient of the function is $\nab f = \tvek \ln(xy) + 1  \\
x/y\ttor$.
At the point $(2, \frac{1}{2})$ this is $\nab f = \tvek 1 \\ 4\ttor$,
so the linear approximation is
\[
f(x, y) \approx f(2, \frac{1}{2}) + 1\cdot(x-2)+4\cdot(y-\frac12),
\]
i.e.
\[
f(x, y) \approx 1(x-2) + 4(y-\frac12).
\]
(This is also the answer to problem~\ref{prb:ln-tan-plane}.)

Here we don't want to describe the tangent plan, but we want to find
the value of $f(x, y)$ for $(x,y) = (1.98, 0.4)$.  Substituting these
values of $x$ and $y$ in the linear approximation we get $f(1.98, 0.4)
\approx (1.98-2) + 4 (0.4-0.5) = -0.42$.

This is only an approximation, and you wonder how good it is.  We have
$\Delta x = 1.98-2 = -0.02$, and $\Delta y = 0.4 - \frac12 =
-0.1$\ldots are these numbers ``small''?  To find the error in the
approximation you could use a Lagrange-type remainder term, but that's
not part of math 234.  Instead we grab a calculator and compute
$f(1.98, 0.4) = 1.98\cdot \ln(1.98\cdot 0.4) = -0.46172\cdots$.  So
our linear approximation formula is off by $0.04\cdots$.

 The point $(x, y, z)$ lies on the intersection if $z=xy$ and
$z=bx+ay-ab$.  Therefore $x$ and $y$ must satisfy
$xy-bx-ay+ab = 0$.  This equation factors as follows:
\[
xy-bx-ay+ab = (x-a)(y-b) =0,
\]
so that the intersection contains the line $x=a$, $z=ay$, and
also the line $y=b$, $z=bx$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(IV10.2)}]

$\pdd{(f+g)}x = f_x + g_x$, and $\pdd{(f+g)}y = f_y + g_y$, so

The gradient is $\nab f = \tvek 2x \\ 8y\ttor$.  This vector is

$\nab f = s\tvek1\\1\ttor$, i.e.\ $\tvek f_x \\f_y\ttor  = \tvek
s\\s\ttor$.  This happens if $f_x(x, y) = f_y(x, y)$.  From our
computation of the partial derivatives of $f$ we find that $\nab f$ is
parallel to $\tvek1\\1\ttor$ when $2x=8y$.  This happens at every
point on the line $y=\tfrac14x$.

We are asked which points on the level set $f=4$ satisfy this
condition, so we must find where the line $y=\frac14x$ intersects the
level set $x^2 + 4y^2 = 4$.  Solving the two equations gives two

\textbf{Note: } when you solve the equations $\nab g = \tvek s\\s\ttor$, you
find $y=2x$, but also the line $y=0$ ($x$-axis).
On this line the gradient actually vanishes, i.e.\ $\nab g = \vvv0$

To keep its temperature constant the bug should walk in any direction
perpendicular to the gradient.  The vector $\tvek 81 \\ -2\ttor$ is
perpendicular to the gradient, so the bug should go in the direction
of $\tvek 81 \\ -2\ttor$ or the opposite direction, $\tvek -81 \\ 2\ttor$.

Any non-zero multiple of $\tvek -81 \\ 2\ttor$ is also a valid answer,
since we can only give the \textit{direction} and not the speed.

Remember: the vector $\tvek -b\\a\ttor$ is perpendicular to
$\tvek a\\b\ttor$.

A function of two variables has

The ones ``below the diagonal'' are the same as corresponding derivatives

The quantity $4(x^3-x^4) = 4x^3(1-x)$ is negative when $x<0$ or
$x>1$, so the region is confined to the vertical strip $0\leq x \leq
1$.  Within this strip $R$ is comprised of those points which satisfy
$-\sqrt{4(x^3-x^4)} \leq y \leq +\sqrt{4(x^3-x^4)}$.  The largest
$x$ value is attained at the point with $x=1$, where $y=0$, so, at the
point $(1,0)$.  The smallest $x$ value is attained at the point
$(0,0)$.   The largest $y$ value is attained at the point where
$y^2 = 4x^3-4x^4$ is maximal.  This happens when $x=\frac 34$, and the
largest $y$ value is therefore $\sqrt{4[(3/4)^3-(3/4)^4]} = \frac

There is exactly one critical point, at $(x, y) = (1,-1)$.

The 2nd order Taylor expansion at this point is
\[
f(1+\Delta x, -1+\Delta y) =
f(1, -1) + (\Delta x)^2 + 4(\Delta y)^2 +\cdots

$f_x = 2x+6$, $f_y = -2y-10$, $f_{xx} = 2$, $f_{xy}=0$, $f_{yy}=-2$.

There is exactly one critical point, at $(x, y) = (-3,-5)$.

The 2nd order Taylor expansion at this point is

The quadratic part factors, therefore $f$ has a
\emph{saddle point} at $(-3, -5)$.  The level set near the critical
point consists of two crossing curves whose tangents are given by the
equations $\Delta x=\Delta y$ and $\Delta x=-\Delta y$.  Since
$\Delta x=x-a=x+3$ and $\Delta y = y-b = y+5$, the two tangent lines
have equations $x+3 = y+5$ and $x+3 = -(y+5)$.

point consists of two crossing curves whose tangents are given by the
equations $\Delta x=-(2+\surd 3)\Delta y$ and $\Delta x=-(2-\surd

$f_x = 2x-y-5$, $f_y = -x+4y+6$, $f_{xx} = 2$, $f_{xy}=-1$, $f_{yy}=4$.

There is again one critical point: $x=2$, $y=-1$.

+ 2(\Delta y)^2 +\cdots\\
&= f(2, -1) + \bigl(\Delta x-\tfrac12\Delta y\bigr)^{2}

$f_x = -36x+4x^3$, $f_y = 2y$, $f_{xx} = -36+12x^2$, $f_{xy}=0$,
$f_{yy}=2$.

The equation $f_x=0$ has three solutions, $x=0$ and $x=\pm3$.
The equation $f_y=0$ has only one solution $y=0$.
Therefore there are three critical points, the origin and the points
$(\pm 3,0)$.

The taylor expansions at these points are
\begin{align*}
f(\Delta x, \Delta y)
&= f(0,0) -18 (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + \cdots \\
&= f(0,0) + \bigl(\Delta y-\sqrt{18} x\bigr)\bigl(\Delta y+\sqrt{18} x\bigr)

f(3+\Delta x, \Delta y)
&= f(3,0) +36 (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + \cdots \\
f(-3+\Delta x, \Delta y)
&= f(-3,0) +36 (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + \cdots
\end{align*}
The second order terms in the Taylor expansions at $(3,0)$ and at
$(-3,0)$ are both positive for all $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$, so both
points $(\pm3, 0)$ are local minima.  The second order part of the
expansion at the origin factors and hence the origin is a saddle
point.  The tangents to the zeroset at the origin are the lines
$\Delta y = \pm \sqrt{18}\Delta x = \pm 3\sqrt2 \Delta x$.  Since here
$\Delta x = \text{``}x-a\text{''} = x$, and $\Delta y = y$, the
tangents are the lines through the origin given by $y=\pm 3\sqrt2 x$.

You can try to draw the zeroset of this function and analyze it in the
same way as the ``fishy example'' in \ref{sec:critical-fish}.  The
zeroset of $f$ consists of the graphs of $y = \pm \sqrt{18x^2-x^4} =

It looks like a squashed ``$\infty$'' or a butterfly (you decide.)

Second order Taylor expansion at the critical point:
\[
f(-1+\Delta x, -\tfrac16+\Delta y) = f(1, -\tfrac16)
-2(\Delta x)^2-3(\Delta y)^2 + \cdots

The second order terms are always negative so $(1, -\tfrac16)$ is a

f_{xy}=4-2x-4y,\quad f_{yy}=-4x.
\]
This function is given in factored form, so without solving the
equations $f_x=0$, $f_y=0$ you can say the following about this
problem.  The zero set consists of the three lines: the $y$-axis
($x=0$), the $x$-axis ($y=0$) and the line with equation $4-x-2y=0$.
It follows that the intersection points $(0,0)$, $(4,0)$, and $(0,2)$
of these lines are saddle points.  Since $f>0$ in the triangle formed
by the three lines this triangle must contain at least one local
maximum.

\begin{center}

To find all critical points solve these equations:
\[
f_x = 4y-2xy-2y^2 = 0 \iff \text{\framebox{$y=0$ or $4-2x-2y=0$}}
\]
and
\[
f_y = 4x-x^2-4xy=0  \iff \text{\framebox{$x=0$ or $4-x-4y=0$}}
\]
Since both equations $f_x=0$ and $f_y=0$ lead to two possibilities, we
have to consider $2\times 2=4$ cases:
\begin{description}
\item[$y=0$ \& $x=0$] This tells us the origin is a critical point
\item[$y=0$ \& $4-x-4y=0$] Solving these equations leads to
$x=4, y=0$, so $(4,0)$ is a critical point.
\item[$4-2x-2y=0$ \& $x=0$] Solve and you find that $(0,2)$ is a
critical point.
\item[$4-2x-2y=0$ \& $4-x-4y=0$] Solve these equations and you get
$(x,y) = (\tfrac43, \tfrac23)$.

$y=0$.  If $y=0$ then $f_x=0$ implies $x=0$, which gives us one
critical point, the origin $(0,0)$.  If on the other hand $x=2$, then
$f_x=0$ implies $y^2=8 \iff y=\pm2\sqrt{2}$.  We therefore get two
more critical points $(2, \pm 2\sqrt{2})$.

The second derivatives are $f_{xx} = 2$, $f_{xy} = -y$, $f_{yy} =
2-x$.  Therefore we have the following Taylor expansions at the
three critical points:
\begin{align*}
f(\Delta x, \Delta y)
&= f(0,0) + (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + \cdots
&\implies \text{loc.min.}\\
f(2+\Delta x, 2\sqrt{2} + \Delta y)
&= f(2, 2\sqrt{2}) + (\Delta x)^2 - 2\sqrt{2} \Delta x \Delta y +
0(\Delta y)^2+\cdots\\
&= f(2, 2\sqrt{2}) + \bigl(\Delta x - 2\sqrt{2} \Delta y\bigr)
\Delta x +\cdots
&\implies \text{saddle}\\
f(2+\Delta x, -2\sqrt{2} + \Delta y)
&= f(2, -2\sqrt{2}) + (\Delta x)^2 + 2\sqrt{2} \Delta x \Delta y +
0(\Delta y)^2+\cdots\\
&= f(2, -2\sqrt{2}) + \bigl(\Delta x + 2\sqrt{2} \Delta y\bigr)
\Delta x +\cdots
&\implies \text{saddle}
\end{align*}

The origin is therefore a local minimum, and the points $(2,
\pm2\sqrt{2})$ are saddle points.  At $(0, 2\sqrt{2})$ the level set
consists of two crossing curves, whose tangents are given by
$\Delta x=0$ (a vertical line) and $\Delta x=2\sqrt{2}\Delta y$ (a line
with slope $1/2\sqrt{2} = \frac14\sqrt{2}$).

$f_x = 1-y^2$, $f_y = 2-2xy$.
Critical points: $f_x=0$ holds when $y=\pm 1$.  If $y=+1$, then
$f_y=0$ implies $x=1$, and if $y=-1$ then $f_y=0$ implies $x=-1$.
There are therefore two critical points, $(1,1)$ and $(-1,-1)$.

$f(x, y) = xy$, $g(x, y) = x^2 + \frac14 y^2$.
$\nab f = \tvek y \\ x\ttor$, $\nab g = \tvek 2x\\ y/2\ttor$.

First we check for possible max/minima which satisfy $\nab g=\vvv0$.
But the only point $(x,y)$ satisfying $\nab g(x,y) = \tvek0\\0\ttor$
is the origin $(x, y) = (0,0)$, and this point does not lie on the
constraint set.

Therefore, \textbf{if} there is a minimum it is attained at a solution
of Lagrange's equations
\begin{align*}
f_x = \lambda g_x &\iff y = 2\lambda x \\
f_y = \lambda g_y &\iff x = \lambda y/2 \\
g(x, y) = 1 & \iff x^2+\tfrac14 y^2 = 1
\end{align*}
Multiply the first equation with $y$ and the second with $4x$, then
you get
\[
y^2 = 2\lambda xy \text{ and } 4x^2 = 2\lambda xy
\]
Hence $y^2 = 4x^2$.  Put that in the constraint, and you find
\[
1=x^2 + \tfrac14 y^2 = 2 x^2.
\]
Thus $x= \pm\sqrt{1/2} = \pm \frac12 \sqrt{2}$ and $y = \pm \sqrt2$.
In all we have found \emph{four} possible solutions.
Lagrange's method does not tell us which, if any, of these are minima.

Level sets of the function $f(x, y) = xy$ and the constraint set
$x^2+\frac14y^2=1$}

By looking at the constraint set (it's an ellipse with horizontal axis
of length 1 and vertical axis of length 2) and taking into account
that $f(x, y) =xy$ is positive in the first and third quadrants, and
negative in the second and fourth, you find out that the two points
$(\frac12\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2})$ and $(-\frac12\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2})$  ($A$
and $C$ in the figure) are maximum points, while
$(-\frac12\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2})$ and $(\frac12\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2})$  ($B$
and $D$ in the figure) are minimum points.

\item[{\bfseries(V13.2a)}]

Let the sides of the box be $x,y,z$.  We want to minimize the quantity $A =
2xy+2yz+2xz$, with the constraint $V=xyz=\frac12$.  The constraint implies that
$x\neq0$, $y\neq0$ and $z\neq0$ moreover, given $x$ and $y$ the only $z$
which satisfies the constraint is $z=1/(2xy)$.  Thus we must minimize the
following function of two variables
\[
A(x,y) = 2xy + \frac{1} {x} + \frac{1} {y}
\]
over all $x>0$, $y>0$.

A minimum must be an interior minimum (can't be on the $x$ or $y$-axis
since these are excluded), and thus must be a critical point.
\[
\pdd Ax = 2y-\frac{1} {x^2}, \qquad
\pdd Ay = 2x - \frac{1} {y^2}.
\]
Solving $A_x=A_y=0$ for $(x,y)$ leads to $x=y=2^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]2$, so the solution
is a cube $1/\sqrt[3]{2}$ on a side
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(V13.2b)}]

We wish to minimize $A(x,y,z) = 2yz+2xz+2xy$ with constraint
$V(x, y, z) = xyz = \frac12$, using Lagrange's method.

First we check for exceptional points on the constraint set, i.e.\
points $(x,y,z)$ that satisfy both $V(x, y, z) = \frac12 $ and
$\nab V(x, y, z) = \vvv0$.  Since
\[
\nab V = \vek yz \\ xz\\ xy\tor
\]
the gradient $\nab V$ vanishes if at least two of the three
coordinates $x, y, z$ are zero.  But such a point can never satisfy
the constraint $xyz=\tfrac12$.  Therefore, if there is a box with
least area, its sides $x, y, z$ must satisfy Lagrange's equations.

Lagrange's equations are
\begin{align*}
A_x = \lambda V_x &\iff 2y+2z = \lambda yz\\
A_y = \lambda V_y &\iff 2x+2z = \lambda xz\\
A_z = \lambda V_z &\iff 2x+2y = \lambda xy
\end{align*}
To get rid of $\lambda$ multiply the first equation with $x$ and the
second with $y$ to get
\[
y(2x+2z) = \lambda xyz = x(2y+2z) \implies
2xy+2yz = 2xy+2xz \implies 2yz=2xz.
\]
Therefore we find that either $z=0$ or $x=y$.
But $z=0$ is not possible, because $(x,y,z)$ must satisfy the
constraint $xyz=\frac12$.  Therefore we get $x=y$.

If you multiply the second Lagrange equation with $y$ and the third
with $z$ then the same reasoning as above tells you that $y=z$.

So, \emph{if there is a minimum} then it happens when $x=y=z$, i.e.\
when the box is a cube.  The only cube that satisfies the constraint
has sides $x=y=z=2^{-1/3}$.

As always, Lagrange's method does not rule out the possibility that
the cube we have found actually maximizes the surface area, rather
than minimizing it.  That this is not the case is something
you would have to prove by other means.  We will not do that in this
course.

  Answer: the shortest distance is $\sqrt{100/3}$.

Solution:  If $(x, y, z)$ is any point than its distance to the origin
is $d(x, y, z) = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$.  We want to minimize $d(x, y,
z)$ over all points $(x, y, z)$ which satisfy the constraint
$g(x, y, z) = x+y+z=10$.  Instead of minimizing $d(x, y, z)$ we will
minimize $f(x, y, z) = d(x, y, z)^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2$.  You can do this
problem directly with the function $d(x,y,z)$ and you will get the
same answer -- the computations are just a little longer because
$f$ has easier derivatives than $d$.

We use Lagrange's method.  First we check for exceptional points,
i.e.\ points on the constraint set which satisfy $\nab g=\vvv0$.
Since $\nab g = \tvek1\\1\\1\ttor$ the gradient of $g$ can never be
the zero vector, so there are no exceptional points.  If there is a
minimum of $f$ on the constraint set, it must be a solution of
Lagrange's equations.

The Lagrange equations are
\begin{align*}
f_x=\lambda g_x &\iff 2x = \lambda\\
f_y=\lambda g_y &\iff 2y=\lambda\\
f_z=\lambda g_z &\iff 2z=\lambda
\end{align*}
Therefore \emph{if there is a nearest point to the origin on the
plane} then it must satisfy $x=y=z=\lambda/2$ as well as the
constraint.  The only point satisfying these conditions is
$(\tfrac{10}3,\tfrac{10}3,\tfrac{10}3)$.

Lagrange's method does not tell us that this is the nearest point. As
far as Lagrange is concerned it could also be the furthest point from
the origin.  (But because we know what a plane looks like we ``know''
that there has to be a nearest point to the origin.)

Minimize $f(x, y, z) = (x-2)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-4)^2$ subject to the
constraint $g(x, y, z) = 2x-y+3z = 1$.

First, since $\nab g - \tvek 2 \\ -1 \\ 3\ttor \neq \vvv0$, there are
no exceptional points, so the nearest point (if it exists) is a
solution of Lagrange's equations.  These are
\[
2(x-2) = 2\lambda, \quad
2(y-1) = -\lambda, \quad
2(z-4) = 3\lambda.
\]
Eliminate $\lambda$ to get
\[
x=-2y+4, \qquad
z = -3y+7.
\]
Combined with the constraint you then find
\[
y= 2,\quad x=  0, \quad z= 1.
\]
The Lagrange multiplier is $\lambda = x-2 = -2$.

The distance from the point we found to the given point $(2, 1, 4)$ is
\[
d = \sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-4)^2}
=\sqrt{14}

The last integral
is the area of a quarter circle with radius 1, so the answer is $\pi/4$.

\item[{\bfseries(VI3.2)}]

Once you compute the inner integral
\[
\int_0^1 \sin(\pi x) dx  = \left[ -\frac1\pi\cos\pi x \right]_{x=0}^1
=-\frac1\pi\cos \pi - \frac1\pi (-\cos 0) = \frac 2\pi,
\]
you get
\[
\int_x^1 \Bigl\{\int_0^1 \sin(\pi x) dx \Bigr\}dy
=\int_x^1 \frac 2\pi dy = \left[ \frac 2\pi y \right]_{y=x}^1 = \frac 2\pi (1-x).
\]
The result depends on $x$.  The $x$ in the answer and the two $x$-es
in the inner integral refer to different quantities.  This is at best
confusing, and should really never be done.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VI3.3a)}]

Not true!
The order in which $dx$ and $dy$ appear tells you which is the inner integral and which is the outer.  Since $dx$ comes first, the inner integral is with respect to $x$, and therefore the bounds for $x$ are $0\leq x \leq 2$.

To give a counterexample for the statement in the problem, almost any
two functions $f$ and $g$ will do.  For instance, if you choose $f(x) = x$, $g(y)=1$, then you get
\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^2 f(x) g(y) \; dx\; dy= \int_0^1\int_0^2 xdx dy = 2.
\]
but
\[
\int_0^1 f(x) \; dx\; \times\;
\int_0^2 g(y)\; dy
=
\int_0^1 x \; dx\; \times\;
\int_0^2  dy
=
\frac{1}{2}\times2 = 1.
\]
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VI3.3b)}]

True!
\[
  \int_0^2\int_0^1 f(x)g(y) dx dy
  =\int_0^2\left\{ \int_0^1 f(x)g(y) dx \right\}dy .
\]
Since $g(y)$ does not depend on $x$, we have
\[
\int_0^1 f(x)g(y) dx=g(y) \int_0^1 f(x)\, dx.
\]
Therefore
\[
  \int_0^2\left\{ \int_0^1 f(x)g(y) dx \right\}dy
  =\int_0^2 g(y) \left\{\int_0^1 f(x) dx \right\}dy .
\]
The integral $\int_0^1 f(x)dx$ is a constant, and does therefore not depend on $y$,
so we can factor it out of the $y$-integral:
\[
  \int_0^1 f(x) \left\{\int_0^2 g(y) dy \right\}dx
  = \int_0^1 f(x)\, dx \cdot \int_0^2 g(y)\, dy,
\]
which is what we had to show.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VI3.3c)}]

This is false, but it is a fairly common mistake, probably resulting from the following quick but wrong line of thought:  {\itshape in the disc $D$ the smallest $x$value is $x=-1$ on the left, and the largest $x$ is $x=+1$ on the right; the smallest and largest $y$ are $y=-1$ and $y=+1$, therefore the double integral should be $\int_{-1}^1\int_{-1}^1 \cdots dx\,dy$. }  This is not right, because the integral  $\int_{-1}^1\int_{-1}^1 \cdots dx\,dy$ is over the region defined by the inequalities $-1\leq x\leq 1$, $-1\leq y\leq 1$, which is a square (it's the smallest square that fits around the disc $D$).

To give a counterexample which shows that this fails, you could evaluate both sides with $f(x) = 1$ and $g(y)=1$.  On the left you get the area of the disc $D$, which is $\pi$, and on the right you get $2\cdot2=4$.

leads to this integral:
\[
\text{K.E.} = \liiint_D \tfrac12\mu v(r)^2\; dV
= \tfrac12\mu \liiint_D v(r)^2\; dV

In cylindrical coordinates the domain is defined by $0\le r\le R$ and
$0< z \le H$, so the integral is

\int_{\theta=0}^{2\pi}\int_{z=0}^{H}\int_{r=0}^R
\frac{r}{1+r^2}\; dr\; dz\; d\theta

$\vx(t) = \tvek t \\ t^2\ttor$ is a parametrization, so the integral
becomes
\[
\int_\cC x\; ds
= \int_{t=0}^1 \underbrace{t}_{x=t} \;
\underbrace{\sqrt{1+4t^2}}_{\|\vx'(t)\|} \; dt
=
\left[

=\frac{5\sqrt{5}-1}{12}.
\]
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII4.5a)}]

$a, H, L$ are lengths; $T_0$ is a temperature.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII4.5b)}]

$a= 1$ is the radius of the cylinder on which the helix lies, and
$H=\pi/2$ is the height of one turn of the helix.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII4.5c)}]

The average is
\[
\text{average temp.  }=
\frac{\int_\cC T\; ds}{\int_\cC\; ds} .
\]
With the given parametrization $ds = \|\vx'(t)\|\; dt =
\sqrt{a^2 + H^2/4\pi^2}\; dt$ -- an ugly expression, but it's
constant, which is good for integrating.
You get
\[
\int_\cC ds = \int_0^{2\pi} \sqrt{a^2 + H^2/4\pi^2}\; dt
=2\pi\sqrt{a^2 + H^2/4\pi^2}=
\sqrt{4\pi^2a^2+H^2}.
\]
and
\begin{align*}
  \int_\cC T\; ds
  &= \int_0^{2\pi} T_0 e^{-Ht/2\pi L}\sqrt{a^2 + H^2/4\pi^2}\; dt\\
  &= T_0 \sqrt{a^2 + H^2/4\pi^2} \left[ -\frac{2\pi L}{H} e^{-Ht/2\pi L}
  \right]_{t=0}^{2\pi} \\
  &= T_0 \sqrt{a^2 + H^2/4\pi^2} \frac{2\pi L}{H} \left[ 1- e^{-H/L} \right].
\end{align*}
Therefore the average temperature is
\[
\text{average temp.  }=
\frac{L}{H} \bigl(1-e^{-H/L}\bigr)\; T_0.
\]
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII8.1)}]

Yes.  It is the gradient of $f(x, y) = gy$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII8.3)}]

By Clairaut's theorem, if $\vF$ is a gradient, then $P_y = Q_x$.

By the fundamental theorem for line integrals, if $\vF$ is a gradient, then
$\oint_\cC \vF\dpp d\vx =0$ (or, equivalently, $\oint_\cC Pdx+Qdy=0$) for every
closed curve $\cC$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII8.4a)}]

$\int_\cC \vF\dpp d\vx = \int_\cC xdx = 0 $.

$\int_\cC \vG\dpp d\vx = \int_\cC xdy = \pi$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII8.4b)}]

Since $\int_\cC \vG\dpp d\vx \neq0$ the vector field $\vG$ cannot be a gradient.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII8.4c)}]

The integral $\int_\cC\vf\dpp d\vx$ vanishes, but to check that $\vF$ is conservative
one has to check $\int_\cC\vf\dpp d\vx =0 $ for \emph{all} closed curves $\cC$, and
not just the unit circle.  So our integral computation does not imply that $\vF$ is a
gradient.

You can use different arguments to show directly that $\vF$ is a gradient, for
instance, by noting that $\nab (\frac12 x^2) = \tvek x\\0 \ttor$, or if you're not
that lucky, by using the methods of \S~IV.\ref{sec:finding-f-from-its-derivs}.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII12.2b)}]

The answer in both cases is the same (because they are two different ways of
computing the same integral).  The second approach, using Green's theorem leads to
\[
\int_\cC 2y\,dx + 3x\,dy
= \iint\limits_\cR \Bigl(\pdd{3x}x - \pdd{2y}y\Bigr)dA
= \iint\limits_\cR (3-2)\,dA,
\]
so the answer is the area of the square, i.e.~$1$
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII12.3)}]

Using Green's theorem we get zero.  But here we do not need Green's theorem: the
Fundamental Theorem for line integrals (see
\S~{sec:integral-over-closed-curve-of-gradient-vanishes}) tells us that this integral must be zero.

If $\vv$ is the gradient of some function, then its curl must vanish.
Therefore $\va\cp\vm=\vvv0$ in view of part \ref{prb:05cross-prod-of-aexpmx}

be parallel.

It says that the divergence of the gravitational field of the Earth is zero.

$\nab\cp(\rho\vx) = (\nab \rho)\cp \vx + \rho \nab\cp\vx = \vvv0$
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII17.11)}]

$\vv(x, y, z) = \tvek -y \\x \\ 0\ttor$
so $\nab\cp\vv = \tvek 0\\0\\2\ttor = 2\vk$.

$\vv(x, y, z) =

   x(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{n/2} \\ y(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{n/2} \\ z(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{n/2}
\tor$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII17.12b)}]

Using the product rule, you get

\nab(\rho^{n}\vx)
= (\nab \rho^{n})\dpp\vx + \rho^{n}\nab\dpp\vx
= -n\rho^{n-1}(\nab\rho)\dpp\vx + \rho^{n}\nab\dpp\vx.
\]
Now recall (or compute again):
\[
\nab \rho = \frac{\vx} {\rho}, \text{ and }
\nab\dpp\vx = 3.
\]
This leads to
\[
\nab(\rho^{n}\vx)
= n \rho^{n-1}\frac{\vx} {\rho}\dpp\vx + 3 \rho^{n}
= n \rho^{n-2}\|\vx\|^2 + 3 \rho^{n}

\]

\item[{\bfseries(VII17.12c)}]

$n=-3$.
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII17.13)}]

There are a long and a short answer.
The long(er) computation goes likes this:
\[
\nab F(\rho)
= \vek F(\rho)_x\\ F(\rho)_y \\ F(\rho)_z\tor
= \vek F'(\rho)\rho_x\\ F'(\rho)\rho_y \\ F'(\rho)\rho_z\tor
= F'(\rho)\vek \rho_x\\\rho_y\\\rho_z\tor.
\]
Now recall (\ref{eq:05gradient-of-rho}), and you find
\[
\nab F(\rho)
=F'(\rho)\vek x/\rho\\y/\rho\\z/\rho\tor
=\frac{1} {\rho}F'(\rho) \vx.
\]
The short computation is essentially the same, but you never
write the components of the vectors:
\[
\nab F(\rho) = F'(\rho) \nab \rho = \frac{1} {\rho}F'(\rho)\vx.
\]
\bigskip

\item[{\bfseries(VII17.13a)}]

If $f(x, y, z)= F(\rho)$, then by the previous problem
we have $\nab f = \rho^{-1}F'(\rho) \vx$.   We want this to be equal to
$\rho^{-n}\vx$, so $F(\rho)$ must satisfy
\[
\rho^{-1}F'(rho) = \rho^{n} \implies
F'(\rho) = \rho^{1+n} \implies
F(\rho) = \frac{\rho^{2+n}} {2+n} +C
\]
for some constant $C$.   We are only asked to find on function $f$,
so we find that the given vector field is indeed the gradient of a radially
symmetric function:
\[
\vv = \rho^{n}\vx = \nab \bigl(\frac{\rho^{2+n}} {2+n}\bigr).
\]
The exceptional case is when $n=-2$, in which case you get
$F(\rho) = \ln \rho$.
